</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
As a Denver-born first-generation American, I worry that the Denver of today does not afford the same opportunities for upward mobility that my immigrant parents used to lift themselves out of poverty. Denver has experienced rapid growth over the past few years and we have significant work ahead to prepare Denver for the future and protect families who are struggling to make ends meet. We need creative problem-solving to invest in housing availability, a next-generation workforce, critical physical infrastructure, and a revitalized system of social services that reduces poverty and improves the path to self-sufficiency.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
Denver residents need abundant housing options to reflect their needs, lifestyles, and income levels. We can address housing scarcity through zoning reforms to enable thoughtful density, such as eliminating parking minimums and allowing accessory dwelling units (ADUs) city-wide. In addition, many multifamily properties are held by massive corporations that rely on software to maximize profits by keeping units vacant. The city must use its power to rebalance the market and make more housing units available for Denverites, up to and including a potential vacancy tax. I will also work to improve the construction permitting process, which can be unreasonably slow and confusing, to expand our supply of both affordable and market-rate housing.</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
I support redeveloping the Park Hill golf course property because the plan being presented to voters addresses gaps in food security, provides critical housing availability, and creates one of the city’s largest parks. The proposal was thoughtfully constructed with input from constituents across the city and in this community. However, it is not perfect, and I am concerned about displacement of both families and small businesses. If Denver voters choose to remove the conservation easement and allow the development, I will hold both the developer and the City accountable to keep their promises to Park Hill neighbors.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
In the post-pandemic economy, Denver seems to have a great deal of unused commercial real estate. Central downtown needs to adapt and grow into a more complete neighborhood with more housing (including adaptive reuse of some commercial buildings), new business developments, city facilities, infrastructure, and entertainment options. We need to make it easier for commuters, families and visitors to navigate to downtown Denver by improving safe, inexpensive, and reliable public transit, opening up more childcare centers, and supporting local businesses to create a sense of place unique to Denver.</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
Not every problem needs a cop. We rely too heavily on our police in Denver, and I believe we can more thoughtfully address issues linked to a weak safety net and systemic underinvestment of resources. Building on the successful STAR program, we can expand alternative interventions and address the root causes behind why crime is occurring in both the short and long term. Using community resources and direct service professionals to address mental health, substance misuse, and housing needs will directly strengthen our public safety net while also reducing crime and promoting prosperity across the city.</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
I am proud to be a Denverite and I love our city’s history and its modern-day vibrancy. To preserve our values and urban identity, we must keep growing in a way that maintains strong, healthy, resilient neighborhoods. We should be intentional in encouraging growth that accommodates everyone in our city at all stages of their lives. To achieve these goals, we need to evaluate and modernize our zoning code and practices to enable gentle density, address the “missing middle,” and diversify our housing options. In this way, we can build distinctive, attractive neighborhoods which protect longtime Denverites and support newcomers.</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
Homelessness is a complex problem and I wish there was a single solution. People are unhoused for a variety of reasons and sweeps as they exist today are not effective. Instead, they ignore the root issues and move our unhoused residents from one neighborhood to the next. I will work to include case management in the city’s approach to addressing encampments, while also encouraging a housing-first model that involves wraparound services. We need to tackle homelessness in a holistic manner, delivering short- and long-term solutions throughout our entire public services ecosystem.</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
Denver’s current snow plowing policy is well-intentioned but outdated, based historically on air particulates and runoff. We need to reevaluate our climate and air pollution data, rely on modern technologies to determine street usage needs, and revise our approach. One simple improvement would be to provide real-time plowing updates so Denverites and the navigation technology tools they rely on know in which order streets are slotted to be plowed.</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
Denver is at a tipping point, and we need an intentional approach to sustain our values and sense of community while protecting and expanding Denver's economic opportunities. I will fight for a greener, more affordable, more prosperous, and safer Denver for current and future generations. In my vision for Denver’s future, we will have frequent, reliable, and fare-free public transportation; subsidized childcare; reduce our over-reliance on police by building out alternative interventions; and streamline permitting and licensing processes to support businesses large and small. Denver is a great city today and we can be even better in the future.</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
Private cars comprise Denver’s largest source of greenhouse gases and ozone pollution. We can and must do more to enable Denverites to move around the city without an over-reliance on cars. The city’s ebike rebates have been wildly popular, but too many streets lack safe biking infrastructure to enable everyone to ride. I will improve public transportation and encourage diverse micro-mobility and multimodal options. I will also put us on a path to plant 250,000 more trees to reduce heat island effects, defend against Denver's historic smog, and improve public health and well-being.</div>

<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
Most urgent issue: Lack of housing options and affordability
- Incentivize affordable development
- Keep people in their homes
- Create opportunities for homeownership</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
- Address permitting delays, considering fee waivers or reductions when appropriate, and leverage vacant city-owned property
- Expand property tax relief and emergency rent assistance programs, provide tax credits for building upgrades, and create community land trusts
- Allow for ADUs citywide, invest in down payment assistance programs, and help connect prospective homeowners to affordable credit</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
I do not support the current PHGC development plans. We should protect our finite green space and ensure that any use of this land truly benefits the entire city and our taxpayers.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
- Make downtown desirable again through public safety improvements, beautification, and small business support
- Get serious about our approach to housing-first
- Encourage shared street experiences and activation of otherwise unused space
- Explore opportunities for affordable and workforce housing in Upper Downtown</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
- Youth violence, create a sustainable funding source for after-school and youth violence prevention providers, connect our young adults to apprenticeship and mental health services, expose our kids to positive environments and experiences
- Traffic Safety, deliver a complete network of sidewalks, formally recognize VAMOS low-intensity bike routes, repair our broken roads, and reduce the number of cars on the street by creating better public transit options</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
Yes, we should create a complete spectrum of housing affordability and as many neighborhoods as possible, with a focus on adding density near existing transit and services</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
We should stop the inhumane sweeps. Sweeps waste precious resources by simply moving our unhoused neighbors from place to place, do not address root cause issues, and rob people of their basic dignity as human beings.</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
Yes, Denver should explore a more data-driven and proactive snow-plowing policy.</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
- A place where regular people can once again afford to work and live in
- A place where people can expect to enjoy, raise a family, and grow old, free of any fears of crime or harm
- A place that prioritizes being a city in a park and protects our precious resources for future generations
I will show up and listen to the community, pass substantive legislation, and ensure that our city's budget reflects our shared values to chip away at making this vision a reality</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
- Reduce the amounts of cars on the street and create better public transit options
- Plant more native trees
- Conserve and protect our precious water resources
- Encourage the use of recycled building materials in new developments</div>

</div>
</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
Housing is the most pressing issue facing our city today, and also the starting place to solving many of our other related challenges. When people experiencing homelessness are offered housing and services; they keep housing and stay in it; they spend less time in shelters, emergency rooms, and city detox facilities; and they are less likely to get caught up in the criminal legal system. Dense housing reduces our city’s climate impact, and affordable housing allows teachers to live in the neighborhoods where they teach. For families to put down generational roots in our city, we must first tackle our affordable housing crisis.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
Denver should pursue three concurrent strategies to address our city’s affordable housing crisis: strengthen protections for renters like funding eviction defense and considering a citywide rent stabilization policy, reforming land use and permitting to rezone for ADUs and increase supply, and increasing supports like rehousing response and wraparound services for people in need.</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
Our city needs more affordable housing to support our working families and keep people in their communities. As a Denver city councilmember, I will work to increase the number of units set aside at affordable AMI levels in future projects like the Park Hill golf course redevelopment.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
Growing up, I worked at our family flower shop, restaurant and various other small businesses in North Denver. I know the challenges that small business owners face, and those have only increased as our downtown core has become increasingly expensive and inaccessible for the local businesses that are the core of our city’s vibrant economy. As your next Denver councilperson at-large, I would increase options and support for small businesses to occupy key storefronts downtown, infusing our city’s busiest commercial area with local energy and culture.</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
We know what makes communities unsafe: a mixture of root causes like housing instability, a lack of access to behavioral health treatment, unemployment and exploitative jobs, and access to guns. I will tackle community safety at the root level with targeted investments to keep people housed, increase access to behavioral health services, secure good jobs that pay a living wage, and reduce gun violence.</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
Although each neighborhood has unique needs, our city as a whole is experiencing an acute lack of affordable housing. Denverites should have the choice to add an accessory dwelling unit to their property, or to put multiple units on one lot instead of just one. This should be done responsibly, ensuring neighborhoods and communities are not disrupted and people are not displaced. Adding more units responsibly and with intention can increase our housing supply and reduce costs.</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
There are three primary drivers of housing instability and homelessness: housing costs, lack of affordable wages, and evictions. Until we address these root causes, the practice of homeless sweeps only serves to move people from street corner to another. This is not only cruel but ineffective. My focus will be on addressing the root causes of homelessness by increasing our supply of affordable housing, supporting workforce development and pipelines to good-paying jobs, and strengthening protections for renters to prevent cycles of eviction and housing instability.</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
What plowing policy? There are parts of our city that do not see plows for days after a snowstorm, by which time we have ice packed onto our streets and sidewalks, making travel unsafe and inaccessible for many. This is a continuation of our city’s chronic disinvestment in communities of color and areas where working people live. We don’t have transit, we don’t have sidewalks, we don’t have clean air. Sometimes, we don’t have access to a grocery store. On City Council, I’ll work to rectify this chronic disparity of resource allocation.</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
Denver must become a city where working people can put down generational roots. We get there with bold policies to address our two most pressing issues: an affordable housing crisis and a desperate need to address the root causes of crime. I have the experience and track record of delivering on these two priorities at the State Legislature, and I’ll continue to do the same on Denver City Council.</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
At the State Legislature, I’ve run numerous policies to hold corporate polluters accountable, establishing a statewide framework for regulating corporations that spew deadly air toxins into areas like North Denver. Similarly, we must make the necessary investments to create a thriving public transportation system that provides regular and consistent transit options, reducing our dependency on cars and providing equitable, affordable, safe, and clean transit options in every corner of the city.</div>

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
The increase in crime over the past several years makes Denverites feel less safe, hurts economic development, and drains our city of resources. We must bolster youth intervention programs, economic development, transitional and affordable housing, and treatment for addiction and mental health issues. These root causes of much criminal behavior are long-term investments that will impact the community now and into the future. At the same time, we need to ensure law enforcement has the resources and training it needs to address the acute problem of crime that is happening right now in Denver.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
First, we must allow for increased density and infill here in Denver. This includes re-zoning for ADUs across the city, more flexibility in the type of units that can be built in residential areas, and transit hub infill. Second, we must speed up the permitting process for new building. This will involve making sure the relevant departments have the necessary staff to efficiently move proposals through the process and looking for areas where there are redundancies or unnecessary red tape. Third, the city should aggressively look for opportunities to purchase land and buildings to boost affordable housing options.</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
Yes, I support the redevelopment. We can have both more housing, including hundreds of units at affordable rates, and ample park space. Boosting available housing is key to making sure Denver can grow responsibly. Targeting new housing on part of a bankrupt golf course with provisions to ensure the surrounding Park Hill community benefits from the development and bringing into existence one of the largest parks in the city is a good use of this land. I would work to hold the developer to the agreements and promises made to ensure affordable housing and green space.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
Attracting workers back to the central business district and continuing to attract conventions and large-scale gatherings are both crucial to the revitalization. This requires making it feel both safe and beautiful. I am heartened to see recently introduced initiatives that increase visibility, pedestrian traffic, and coordination to address public safety concerns and would look to bolster and expand these programs. Bringing in diverse small businesses and retail to fill vacant store fronts, improvements and additional greening of the built environment will make downtown a destination once again. Where feasible, adaptive reuse should also be encouraged.</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
The proliferation of guns in our community, especially amongst our young people. The vast majority of homicides and aggravated assaults I prosecuted involved young people, drugs and alcohol, and handguns. City Council has already taken steps like the banning of “ghost guns” and I would want to expand on this work by looking at increased waiting periods for the purchase of firearms and increasing the age at which such purchases can be made. We also need continued focus and funding for community-based violence interruption and youth diversion programs.</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
Yes, we need more permissive zoning in Denver and it need not come at the expense of neighborhood character and history. Soft infill, such as allowances of duplexes and triplexes, boost the overall stock of housing and make it more affordable and do not alter the unique character of each of Denver’s 78 neighborhoods. Growth should happen across the city and not just confined to certain areas, many of which have been historically marginalized. Targeting some of the development around transit hubs, such as light rail stations, will also allow for more seamless integration.</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
Yes, with an emphasis on offering services and options to those affected. Sweeping an encampment without providing alternatives doesn’t solve the problem and will make it worse by creating more instability and distrust between those unhoused neighbors and city agencies. It is unacceptable for there to be anyone sleeping on our streets in 2023. It is a tragedy for those experiencing it, and harms our neighbors and community as a whole. It creates public health and transportation difficulties. I believe we should enforce the camping ban with a focus on moving people into more stable settings.</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
We do not have the resources to plow every street in Denver after every large snow storm, but we can do more than what we do currently. Too often, there are crosswalks that are effectively ice rinks and piles of snow blocking bus stops. We also need to adapt to situations that arise and require more snow removal. When we have a large snowfall followed by an extended period of cold days, even frequently used streets become impassable with deep pot holes and black ice. We can do better.</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
Denver has an incredible opportunity to serve as a guiding light for cities around the world and show that a growing city need not lose its roots and its essence. We can marry the need for development with the unique vibrancy of our neighborhoods and ensure that each part of our city is connected via transportation, culture, and commerce. Denver can be a place that combines the best outdoors and nature access alongside world-class restaurants, arts, business, and innovation. I can help provide the infrastructure and base upon which every Denverite can flourish and build this future.</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
The city is already taking steps, via the e-bike rebate and energy efficient rebate programs, that will reduce our overall climate impact. Bolstering these initiatives with added incentives xeriscaping and energy efficient new buildings should also be priorities. Building a truly multimodal transportation infrastructure via shared streets, protected bike lanes, bus lines, and other micro mobility options will allow Denverites to get from point A to point B safely and efficiently, while also reducing our dependence on cars.</div>

<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
Since launching my campaign, one theme remains clear—Denver needs a turnaround and leaders who can get processes moving. <em>The remainder of the candidate's answer was not responsive to the question.</em></div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
If elected, I would work with colleagues to take the following steps to onboard more affordable housing: (1) strengthen the Affordable Housing Review Team to ensure that exclusively affordable housing developments receive expedited city review; (2) facilitate speedier approval for projects aimed at delivering housing; (3) work closely with the executive branch to provide legislative support that will improve customer service and refine internal processes across city agencies; (4) preserve existing affordable housing units that will lose their affordability over the next 5-10 years; (5) add to Denver’s land bank and utilize investment strategies like land trusts to bring down costs of real estate; and (6) waive sales and use tax to build 100% affordable housing developments.</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
<em>Candidate's answer was not responsive to the question.</em></div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
(1) Work collaboratively with regional partners to build more housing with wrap-around services for the homeless. (2) Invest in creative, near term strategies to shelter those in unsanctioned encampments. (3) Dedicate resources to effective policing strategies like boosting the number of police along commercial corridors and directing more support to STAR Program. <em>Part of answer not responsive to the question removed.</em> (6) Activate more housing in downtown Denver through new builds and adaptive reuse; (7) Recruit new business to downtown Denver. Portions of candidate's answer were not responsive to the question.</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
<em>Candidate's answer was not responsive to the question.</em></div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
<em>Candidate's answer was not responsive to the question.</em></div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
<em>Candidate's answer was not responsive to the question.</em></div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
Yes. I want to ensure that the successful deployment of core services is front and center under the next council and mayoral administration. The status quo cannot continue.</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
Denver is at an inflection point. Housing is unattainable, homelessness is on the rise, and many neighborhoods feel unsafe. Forty years ago, we were called to imagine a great city. With urgency, we must restore it. A person's zip code is a key determinant of their destiny; not all Denver zip codes are treated equitably. Let's ensure access to parks, libraries, transit, walkability, and safety. We must create a city that fosters innovation and supports small businesses. I envision a city where housing is attainable and shelter is readily available for those in need. We can break down silos and forge new partnerships to get big projects done. The city’s economy is growing, and we must invest in underrepresented groups. I am prepared to deliver clear vision and decisive leadership on day one.</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
We can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprint through smart, sustainable, and equitable investments in neighborhoods–for example, making it easier for the adaptive reuse of older properties. Clean air and water are vital to our city’s future. Enhancing Denver’s tree canopy through climate appropriate strategies will help reduce heat in communities and promote clean air quality. We must be able to move around freely and easily, an essential part of what makes a good quality of life in a growing city. We need to make biking, walking, and micro-modal transportation easier for everyone including broad and unobstructed sidewalks, clearly Work to expand car sharing programs, public transit systems, and adopt a curated, Denver-specific bus route system in partnership with RTD.</div>

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
Economic insecurity. Workers can’t afford housing, eviction filings are way up, the cost of childcare is driving families out of the city, and the precarity created by the pandemic has not yet passed. We need many policy changes — on housing, on climate, on transportation, on public safety — and we need the city to take leadership of its economic future and make sure that nobody is left behind.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
Denver should secure new revenue streams to support city-owned social housing, paired with an audit of city-owned land and buildings that would be suitable for public development. The city should also: preserve existing affordable housing through a small sites fund and a right of first refusal for the city to purchase multi-unit buildings; pass rent stabilization if the state ban is lifted and guarantee counsel in evictions; upzone to allow duplexes, triplexes, and ADUs citywide; consider setting a higher linkage fee under the EHA policy; support community land trusts; and reduce complexity to make permitting faster.</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
No. The last undeveloped green space in the city should be acquired by the city and developed into a park the size of Washington Park with funds from the recently passed parks sales tax. Both infill and tree canopy are important to combatting climate change; building on this space is not infill, and I am also concerned by the creation of metro tax districts and by the affordability level of the promised units in the current plan.</div>
<div></div>
<div>However, once acquired, I would also include the land in a citywide audit of publicly owned land and buildings designed to identify where to build housing. My expectation is that process would identify sufficient areas for brownfield development - green space should be paved only as a last resort - but I would be open to what the results showed.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
All downtowns are more versatile when people from surrounding neighborhoods - in addition to downtown workers, tourists, and venue and conference attendees - are drawn downtown. In Denver, this means making downtown more accessible to foot and bike traffic with connective infrastructure. Smaller downtown buildings might be particularly amenable to adaptive reuse as housing. Tackling the root causes of homelessness is also part of revitalizing downtown.</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
We need a reimagination of public safety, beyond simply crime and toward a definition that takes into account economic insecurity and public health. We need to follow the evidence, which shows that programs like Denver’s STAR responders are effective at resolving mental health crises that don’t require police. The city also needs to treat poverty like a public health crisis, responding directly to social needs with direct and urgent intervention. Many "crimes of poverty" (like violating park rules or public urination) should be reconsidered entirely since arrests and jail time only serve to deepen poverty and homelessness.</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
I support zoning reform and upzoning, because denser and mixed-income communities are good for democracy, forming stronger networks of resilience between people from many backgrounds. In addition, density and walkability help combat climate change and create small business opportunities.</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
To me, the sweeps are wasteful and inhumane. Moving encampments from one street to the next drives people further into chronic homelessness and adds to the harm and disarray of living without housing. We need to invest city resources in solving problems, not sweeping them away.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I believe in housing first, which means connecting people to housing without onerous conditions and with appropriate services. The city should also work to reduce wait times for access to behavioral health services, and expand access to Safe Outdoor Sites, safe parking sites, and tiny homes as a stepping stone to housing.</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
Yes. I’ve litigated disability access cases throughout my career, and the situation on the sidewalks is more than an inconvenience, it's a dangerous hazard to residents. We should of course be thoughtful when changing policy, especially when navigating the air quality concerns underlying the current “plow less” policy, but the status quo of leaving sidewalks, bike lanes, and neighborhood streets as a sea of ice is not acceptable.</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
In 20 years, I want Denver to be a city that works for all of us. I founded my small public interest law firm specifically because I noticed that representation was scarce for low-wage and more marginalized workers in Denver. I’ve seen these disparities in countless aspects of our communities, and I want to help dismantle the root of the harmful systems – in housing, in transportation, in climate – that hold Denver back from reaching a lasting and shared prosperity. It's time we invest in each other.</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
Denver needs to be accelerating its electrification policies, with more funding and incentives for individuals and businesses to speed their green transitions, and a focus on making decarbonizing technologies accessible to everyone regardless of wealth. I support heavy investment in cleanup of polluted neighborhoods, a cutting-edge green building code, and addressing the problem of construction waste.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The city should absolutely be more active in transit, particularly in the building of traffic-calming infrastructure, creating a city-wide network of bike lanes, providing shuttles and connectors for "last mile" service, and working with regional partners for faster and more frequent RTD service.</div>

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
Several strategies are needed to expand affordable housing that will in turn address the deplorable plight of the unhoused. One is the recent City Council ordinance that requires affordable units in any development of a certain size. As a state Senator, I passed a law in 2000 exempting sales and use taxes on materials used in the development of low-income housing. I support proposed state legislation to allow local governments to enact rent control, like legislation I sponsored in 2001. Homeownership, however, is the best way to stabilize housing costs. I will champion financing first-time buyers - many already burdened by with college debt - through land trusts and incentives to incorporate affordable housing into developments around the city.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
I will advocate streamlining the permitting process for affordable housing and expansion of shelter facilities. I will encourage the new administration to evaluate acquiring vacant school buildings and lands owned by the Denver Public Schools as well as other privately owned buildings for new shelters and transitional housing run by professional shelter providers. The city must facilitate wrap-around services, including: job placement, mental health, substance abuse prevention and treatment, and child welfare and protective services for those unhoused escaping violence and domestic abuse.</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
I have been one of the leaders opposing redevelopment of the Park Hill Golf course property for the last 5 years. As a legal matter, a perpetual conservation easement preserves the land for open space and recreation. The city's approval of a small area plan, rezoning, metro district financing, and a land swap agreement with the developer violates state law; a court must determine if the original purposes of the conservation easement are impossible to fulfill due to changes on or surrounding the property since the establishment of the easement in 2019. The land swap - in particular - appears to be an illegal end run on the state constitution to the extent that the land swap provides an unconstitutional benefit to a private person (the developer).</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
We need to meet with retail operators and businesses to understand the impediments to their workforces returning to downtown and explore adaptive reuse for housing. The city must also meet with existing businesses to determine what incentives would encourage new businesses to relocate to downtown to give people a reason to return. We might need to expand Support Team Assisted Response (STAR) program to intervene with public drug users and the unhoused in front of businesses. Violence around the entertainment venues of downtown warrant implementing a phased closing of establishments or a curfew so that all establishments don't close at the same time, releasing thousands of former patrons into the street, some inebriated, with potentially nothing to do.</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
The rise in violent crime and property crimes, particularly car thefts, threatens Denverites’ peace of mind. Denver’s shortage of police officers is an opportunity to aggressively recruit a diverse class of police cadets from our area high schools. Three uncles who were police officers in other cities showed me that neighborhoods respond best to a police force that reflects and looks like the residents they serve. I will closely monitor the progress implementing recommendations of the Reimagining Public Safety Task Force. As co-chair of the citizens committee that recommended establishing the Office of Independent Monitor, I will champion accountability for rogue officers who abuse use of force and diminish the reputation of those officers dedicated to protecting the public.</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
All neighborhoods must absorb inevitable population growth. Greater density, the most environmentally sustainable path to accommodating growth, should be compatible with the character of existing neighborhoods. Accessory Dwelling Units might be the answer to infill in some neighborhoods while high rise developments are appropriate to others. One size may not fit all but permissive zoning might offer the flexibility appropriate for neighborhood area plans that grow out of extensive community engagement. Intentionality must be the key.</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
Sweeping does not solve the problem of the unhoused; it simply moves it from one neighborhood to another without lifting up the unhoused. And it underscores the shortcomings of Denver’s efforts to reduce the population of the unhoused. A profoundly different and more significant investment of resources in addressing the root cause of homelessness is required before additional resources are devoted to sweeps.</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
Denver Snow removal policy, like any other city policy, should be subject to constant review and improvement. This season’s early, wetter snow during colder temperatures has left streets unsafe. Heavy spring snows can rely more on “solar shovels” for side streets.</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
I envision a diverse, equitable city where a variety of housing options - for rent and purchase - are available to people of different economic means and circumstances. The plight of the unhoused will all but be eliminated. Abundant green space within a short walk in every neighborhood will complement - not compete - with development. A revamped and modified transit system undertaken by all of the governments within the Regional Transportation District (RTD), and changes within RTD itself, will draw more riders. Solving the last mile of transit will spur transit oriented development. I am committed to building consensus to solve regional challenges since Denver cannot thrive as an island. Affordable housing and homelessness are examples of problems in need of regional solutions.</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
Colorado’s capital city should be the state’s leader in protecting the environment from poor air quality, diminishing water supply and ground contamination. I spent 12 years on the Board of Denver Water -- several as president. We negotiated agreements with the Western Slopeand suburbs to increase the security of the water supply, advance conservation measures and explore changes in agricultural practices, where over 80% of Colorado’s water is consumed. Groundwater contamination further threatens the water supply and potential reuse. Similarly, the growing deterioration of our air quality will require ongoing collaboration with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and Denver to increase air quality monitoring and protect the historically most vulnerable popualtions.</div>

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
The most urgent issue is the safety of streets. Over 300 people have died or suffered serious bodily injuries on Denver’s streets every year since 2013. It can be addressed by improving sidewalks, improved lighting, reduced speeds and traffic calming designs on the streets that make up the high injury network.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
Approve multi-unit zoning in all residential zone districts. It will allow different housing styles, such as up/down duplexes, accessory dwelling units and even small fourplexes in areas that can absorb lower density developments. It will not end single unit residences, but provide flexibility for housing options.</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
Yes, based on what I know now. More golf courses have closed than opened since 2006, according to several reports. PHGC has been closed since 2018. PHGC can supply public open space and about 5% of the 50,000 needed housing units. The number of temporary construction jobs, permanent maintenance jobs and park-related jobs is a benefit is too large to ignore, plus, the proximity to three transit lines benefits the environment. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that land surrounding the PHGC will be developed.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
I think every infrastructure upgrade should be performed while downtown is relatively empty. It’s somewhat fortuitous that the 16th Street Mall is being reconstructed. I imagine it will be completed ahead of schedule because of easier access.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Otherwise, Denver administration can lead by requiring all office workers to be in the office five days per week. I believe private sector employees will eventually absorb vacant office space as they grow. Denver can provide permitting assistance with conversion of office space to residential units.</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
Traffic safety. Over 300 persons have been killed or suffered serious bodily injuries in crashes every year since 2013. That is an unimaginable loss to their loved ones that can also devastate a household’s finances. Designs to improve walking, rolling, biking and driving safety can be implemented as Denver Deserves Sidewalks funds begin to flow. Speeds on arterial streets should be reduced, sight lines improved and video surveillance for traffic violations implemented along the high injury network.</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
Single-family design can exist while accommodating more persons. I lived in a six-unit Victorian-style house in Minneapolis that looked like every other Victorian house in the neighborhood. Minimum lot sizes per type of unit can also accommodate population growth while preserving single-family character. Allowing various housing types will allow flexibility as the real estate market expands and contracts.</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
No. Several court cases have stated that a jurisdiction must provide an alternative location if the policy prohibits sleeping in public areas. Denver, RTD, the state and Colorado have acres of land around the metro area to provide a place for rest for the unsheltered. Services and protections can be better delivered to identified locations rather than to sites that are, for good reasons, untracked throughout the city and the region.</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
I believe the best-in-the-business meteorologists in Denver should weigh in on this. Denver should change its snow plowing policy if the majority say with confidence that weather patterns will change. I expect residents will be ready to move their cars so plows can clear the streets. Also, a brigade of snow shovelers needs to be engaged to clear curb ramps and cross walks so people who do not drive have full access to the public right-of-way.</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
My vision for Denver is a city where residents are able to take care of their housing, educational, social and mental needs without the aid of city services. I recently heard one of the top ranking public safety officials say that he would like to see a city where the police are not needed. That’s my vision.</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
City officials can protect air quality, water supply and ground contamination by taking a larger role in transit. Brake dust, tailpipe emissions, engine fluids and debris from crashes contribute to degradation of the environment. Denver can better support efforts like the Montbello Connector throughout the city to provide “first mile/last mile” access. Building safe sidewalks to EVERY transit stop is also taking an active role in transit.</div>

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
The most urgent issue facing our city is affordable housing. If we can address this issue, then we can address many of the other issues facing our city. Affordable Housing should not be homogenized. There is transitional housing needed for the homeless to get off the streets, longer-term supportive housing for people who need assistance (like people with disabilities), housing for professionals who cannot afford to buy a house, and housing for seniors and those who wish to downsize, but there is nothing available. Each audience should be served separately under the auspices of a larger, unified plan.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
- For transitional housing, use vacant or underused motels, hotels or other buildings.
- For supportive housing, expand resources so the nonprofits who run these can increase the number of supportive housing communities and benefit from economies of scale in providing services.
- Support community land trusts to reduce displacement.
- Rezone the entire city to allow for accessory dwelling units.
- Address issues with the permitting department that delay construction of new affordable housing units or renovations.
- Work with neighborhoods to promote infill.</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
I favor the plan because:
- Affordable housing is the city’s greatest need and offering it at varying levels and with a preference for people who were displaced from the neighborhood meets my top priorities.
<span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size: 17px">- Environmentally, the plans call for 100 acres for a park, more trees and conserving water with native grasses.
</span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif">- Economically, adding locally owned shops and a grocery store will support residents’ needs and maintain home values.
</span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif">- The land is currently vacant and unsafe. The development will have a well-lit path to connect people with the RTD station without having to walk along Colorado Boulevard.</span></div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
The most significant issues affecting downtown are vacancies, homeless camps, and safety concerns. To address these, I believe that city leaders should work to house and then connect people experiencing homelessness to services, enhance pedestrian walkways and transit connections, work with the Downtown Denver Partnership to update and implement the 2016 Downtown Denver Security Plan, create partnerships through the Business Improvement District to address cleanliness, and build stronger connections with adjacent neighborhoods and Auraria campus. Once these happen, I believe the vacancy rates will reduce and economic growth will continue and expand.</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
There is not one “greatest” public safety concern, there are two: the lack of affordable housing and youth having access to guns. Studies have shown that crime rates drop when people are housed. To address this issue, Denver needs to allow accessory dwelling units citywide, address litigation issues that are ruining the opportunity for middle priced condos to be built and prioritize affordable housing projects in the city’s permitting process.</div>
<div></div>
<div>To keep guns out of the hands of youth, I would like distribute thousands of gun locks and hold adults accountable if a youth has a gun that is not locked.</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
I favor permissive zoning. It has worked in neighborhoods like Lowry where there is affordable housing next to single-family residences and the property values are not negatively affected. I know that an ADU would be a perfect place for my aging mother-in-law so she can afford housing and be close to us if she needs help. An ADU would also work for my children so they can afford to live in Denver when they get their first jobs out of college. The practicalities of the needs of many others (not just family), are more sustainable than protecting single-family neighborhoods.</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
The policy needs to change. I believe that sweeping the homeless encampments as they are now, is ineffective and traumatic for participants. I also believe that the encampments need to be removed because they are negatively affecting businesses and safety and provide a health hazard. My recommendation is that the city should allow for encampments to occur in designated places, preferably on city property. This way the city and nonprofits resources can be provided in those places. In these designated places, the only sweeps will be for cleaning and not to move people who will just set up new camps.</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
The most cost-effective solution for Denver to improve its snow plowing policy is for Denver to engage with neighborhoods to expand the snow angels volunteer corps. These volunteers will be responsible for clearing sidewalks, bike paths and using eco-friendly melting salts when snow remains on the ground for more than two days.</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
In 20 years, I want Denver to be a safe, clean, economic hub. Structurally, I want Denver to have a wide range of housing for all people and have world class public transportation and healthcare. Environmentally, I envision a clean city with many more parks, trees, electric vehicles and less waste.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Economically, I see Denver becoming the small business capital of the U.S. in a worker and business friendly environment where all communities can garner access to capital. To get there, I believe that I can build coalitions, garner input, and facilitate implementable plans to achieve these goals.</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
There are many steps that city officials can take. These range from transitioning grasses in public parks to native grasses that use less water, to offering incentives for homeowners to xeriscape their yards. City officials can also create more parks, plant more trees, and incentivize builders to use greener materials. As for transit, the city must work with RTD to improve public options and make them safe. The city also needs to invest in secure bike lanes and shared streets, continue e-bike rebates, add more EV charging stations and better communicate why electricity burns cleaner than natural gas.</div>
