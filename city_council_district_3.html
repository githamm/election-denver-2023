<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
Affordability in every corner of the city. This covers the broad range of a person or family's ability to find housing, purchase goods, cover basic needs, and have a reasonable quality of life in Denver. It is addressed by supporting options across a spectrum of need from safe outdoor spaces, to permanent supportive housing, subsidized housing, workforce housing, accessory dwelling units and market rate housing. It is further addressed by ensuring families can earn a livable wage.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
Lift barriers faced by affordable housing developers and ensure their projects have key support. Identify housing campus opportunities that can blend housing types (mobile home, apartment, tiny house) in close proximity to community convening resources. Support community land trusts and partner with them to purchase buildings that the city can keep affordable and available. Fine or tax homes that are left vacant for too long and repeat the DHA Delivers for Denver (D3) bond program.</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
I think members of the community laid out a clear vision for what a preferred use of that property is and now present that as an option to Denver voters to consider. I personally support this vision and have been convinced by members of the community that it is a better use of the land to have both housing and retail and a large park, than to have a private golf course.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
Establish a greater connection to the three schools at Auraria Campus for learning and economic branches. There has been significant resident growth downtown, but perhaps it grew quicker than it was able to establish culture and bonds and identity. Residents should have an opportunity to help define the future of downtown Denver. Downtown lost a lot of retail, it would be helpful to look to local businesses and support growth or expansion to downtown corridors as incubation spots. I'm noticing a surge of support for local, cultural, unique retail experiences - it would be amazing to see downtown reflect this.</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
We are in a moment when there are multiple safety concerns that demand our attention and action. In 2022, 82 people died on our streets and 88 people died in homicides, 292 were injured by gun violence. We are driving without regard for pedestrians, bicyclists, wheelchair users and we are choosing to resolve conflict, anger and frustration with violence. Interruption is not our response after the fact, it is proactive investment in our streets and communities in ways that they most need it. For example, in Westwood, in District 3, we are building a new rec center, new library, improved community center, better street corridors and supporting small businesses. This infusion of support needs to happen in all of my district's neighborhoods to interrupt our worst public safety concerns.</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
We can and should be able to absorb density in every neighborhood and we can also have a conversation about where it makes the most sense and what other options exist. I rezoned 3,000 properties in my district to allow for accessory dwelling units on single-family lots in three neighborhoods. We also decreased parking requirements along major transit corridors. Multiple strategies in the right places can get us what we need.</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
Sweeping is cruel and should not continue in its current form. Folks need an option that is not just congregate shelter or jail.</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
Yes, we can do better about plowing residential streets in circumstances under 6 inches of accumulation.</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
My vision is for the inverted-L to be eliminated because we have retained and supported community and not because we have pushed them out. I see Denver as a city that is still welcoming. When I helped build a city welcoming to immigrants, it was because we were already a city welcoming to people from every state in this country. Denver can continue to be a place where newcomers and multi-generational residents feel like they can contribute and be a part of its culture, character, and growth.</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
The South Platte River runs through my district so this question is highly relevant to me and my neighbors. Our only parks are those that sit along gulches that lead to the Platte. We have to take care of our river system and restore what has been ignored and taken for granted for generations.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Yes the city can and should take a more active role in transit, especially the opportunity we have in micro-transit. Not scooters - but neighborhood circulators. We have seen a highly successful pilot in Montbello that GES, Valverde, Westwood and other neighborhoods would love to welcome. And even more effective, if the transit providers were an employee-owned CoOp model. If we are going to spend public dollars, let's really ensure its impact is also local.</div>
