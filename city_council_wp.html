</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    As a Denver-born first-generation American, I worry that the Denver of today does not afford the same opportunities for upward mobility that my immigrant parents used to lift themselves out of poverty. Denver has experienced rapid growth over the past few years and we have significant work ahead to prepare Denver for the future and protect families who are struggling to make ends meet. We need creative problem-solving to invest in housing availability, a next-generation workforce, critical physical infrastructure, and a revitalized system of social services that reduces poverty and improves the path to self-sufficiency.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    Denver residents need abundant housing options to reflect their needs, lifestyles, and income levels. We can address housing scarcity through zoning reforms to enable thoughtful density, such as eliminating parking minimums and allowing accessory dwelling units (ADUs) city-wide. In addition, many multifamily properties are held by massive corporations that rely on software to maximize profits by keeping units vacant. The city must use its power to rebalance the market and make more housing units available for Denverites, up to and including a potential vacancy tax. I will also work to improve the construction permitting process, which can be unreasonably slow and confusing, to expand our supply of both affordable and market-rate housing.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    I support redeveloping the Park Hill golf course property because the plan being presented to voters addresses gaps in food security, provides critical housing availability, and creates one of the city’s largest parks. The proposal was thoughtfully constructed with input from constituents across the city and in this community. However, it is not perfect, and I am concerned about displacement of both families and small businesses. If Denver voters choose to remove the conservation easement and allow the development, I will hold both the developer and the City accountable to keep their promises to Park Hill neighbors.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    In the post-pandemic economy, Denver seems to have a great deal of unused commercial real estate. Central downtown needs to adapt and grow into a more complete neighborhood with more housing (including adaptive reuse of some commercial buildings), new business developments, city facilities, infrastructure, and entertainment options. We need to make it easier for commuters, families and visitors to navigate to downtown Denver by improving safe, inexpensive, and reliable public transit, opening up more childcare centers, and supporting local businesses to create a sense of place unique to Denver.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    Not every problem needs a cop. We rely too heavily on our police in Denver, and I believe we can more thoughtfully address issues linked to a weak safety net and systemic underinvestment of resources. Building on the successful STAR program, we can expand alternative interventions and address the root causes behind why crime is occurring in both the short and long term. Using community resources and direct service professionals to address mental health, substance misuse, and housing needs will directly strengthen our public safety net while also reducing crime and promoting prosperity across the city.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    I am proud to be a Denverite and I love our city’s history and its modern-day vibrancy. To preserve our values and urban identity, we must keep growing in a way that maintains strong, healthy, resilient neighborhoods. We should be intentional in encouraging growth that accommodates everyone in our city at all stages of their lives. To achieve these goals, we need to evaluate and modernize our zoning code and practices to enable gentle density, address the “missing middle,” and diversify our housing options. In this way we can build distinctive, attractive neighborhoods which protect longtime Denverites and support newcomers.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    Homelessness is a complex problem and I wish there was a single solution. People are unhoused for a variety of reasons and sweeps as they exist today are not effective. Instead they ignore the root issues and move our unhoused residents from one neighborhood to the next. I will work to include case management in the city’s approach to addressing encampments, while also encouraging a housing-first model that involves wraparound services. We need to tackle homelessness in a holistic manner, delivering short- and long-term solutions throughout our entire public services ecosystem.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Denver’s current snow plowing policy is well-intentioned but outdated, based historically on air particulates and runoff. We need to reevaluate our climate and air pollution data, rely on modern technologies to determine street usage needs, and revise our approach. One simple improvement would be to provide real-time plowing updates so Denverites and the navigation technology tools they rely on know in which order streets are slotted to be plowed.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    Denver is at a tipping point, and we need an intentional approach to sustain our values and sense of community while protecting and expanding Denver's economy opportunities. I will fight for a greener, more affordable, more prosperous, and safer Denver for current and future generations. In my vision for Denver’s future, we will have frequent, reliable, and fare-free public transportation; subsidized childcare; reduce our over-reliance on police by building out alternative interventions; and streamline permitting and licensing processes to support businesses large and small. Denver is a great city today and we can be even better in the future.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    Private cars comprise Denver’s largest source of greenhouse gases and ozone pollution. We can and must do more to enable Denverites to move around the city without an over-reliance on cars. The city’s ebike rebates have been wildly popular, but too many streets lack safe biking infrastructure to enable everyone to ride. I will improve public transportation and encourage diverse micro-mobility and multimodal options. I will also put us on a path to plant 250,000 more trees to reduce heat island effects, defend against Denver's historic smog, and improve public health and wellbeing.

<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    Most urgent issue: Lack of housing options and affordability
    - Incentivize affordable development
    - Keep people in their homes
    - Create opportunities for homeownership
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    - Address permitting delays, considering fee waivers or reductions when appropriate, and leverage vacant city-owned property
    - Expand property tax relief and emergency rent assistance programs, provide tax credits for building upgrades, and create community land trusts
    - Allow for ADUs citywide, invest in down payment assistance programs, and help connect prospective homeowners to affordable credit
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    I do not support the current PHGC development plans. We should protect our finite green space and ensure that any use of this land truly benefits the entire city and our taxpayers.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    - Make downtown desirable again through public safety improvements, beautification, and small business support
    - Get serious about our approach to housing-first
    - Encourage shared street experiences and activation of otherwise unused space
    - Explore opportunities for affordable and workforce housing in Upper Downtown
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    - Youth violence, create a sustainable funding source for after-school and youth violence prevention providers, connect our young adults to apprenticeship and mental health services, expose our kids to positive environments and experiences
    - Traffic Safety, deliver a complete network of sidewalks, formally recognize VAMOS low-intensity bike routes, repair our broken roads, and reduce the number of cars on the street by creating better public transit options
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    Yes, we should create a complete spectrum of housing affordability and as many neighborhoods as possible, with a focus on adding density near existing transit and services
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    We should stop the inhumane sweeps. Sweeps waste precious resources by simply moving our unhoused neighbors from place to place, do not address root cause issues, and rob people of their basic dignity as human beings.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Yes, Denver should explore a more data-driven and proactive snow-plowing policy.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    - A place where regular people can once again afford to work and live in
    - A place where people can expect to enjoy, raise a family, and grow old, free of any fears of crime or harm
    - A place that prioritizes being a city in a park and protects our precious resources for future generations
    I will show up and listen to the community, pass substantive legislation, and ensure that our city's budget reflects our shared values to chip away at making this vision a reality
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    - Reduce the amounts of cars on the street and create better public transit options
    - Plant more native trees
    - Conserve and protect our precious water resources
    - Encourage the use of recycled building materials in new developments

        </div>
    </div>
</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    Housing is the most pressing issue facing our city today, and also the starting place to solving many of our other related challenges. When people experiencing homelessness are offered housing and services; they keep housing and stay in it; they spend less time in shelters, emergency rooms, and city detox facilities; and they are less likely to get caught up in the criminal legal system. Dense housing reduces our city’s climate impact, and affordable housing allows teachers to live in the neighborhoods where they teach. For families to put down generational roots in our city, we must first tackle our affordable housing crisis.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    Denver should pursue three concurrent strategies to address our city’s affordable housing crisis: strengthen protections for renters like funding eviction defense and considering a citywide rent stabilization policy, reforming land use and permitting to rezone for ADUs and increase supply, and increasing supports like rehousing response and wraparound services for people in need.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    Our city needs more affordable housing to support our working families and keep people in their communities. As a Denver city councilmember, I will work to increase the number of units set aside at affordable AMI levels in future projects like the Park Hill golf course redevelopment.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    Growing up, I worked at our family flower shop, restaurant and various other small businesses in North Denver. I know the challenges that small business owners face, and those have only increased as our downtown core has become increasingly expensive and inaccessible for the local businesses that are the core of our city’s vibrant economy. As your next Denver councilperson at-large, I would increase options and support for small businesses to occupy key storefronts downtown, infusing our city’s busiest commercial area with local energy and culture.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    We know what makes communities unsafe: a mixture of root causes like housing instability, a lack of access to behavioral health treatment, unemployment and exploitative jobs, and access to guns. I will tackle community safety at the root level with targeted investments to keep people housed, increase access to behavioral health services, secure good jobs that pay a living wage, and reduce gun violence.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    Although each neighborhood has unique needs, our city as a whole is experiencing an acute lack of affordable housing. Denverites should have the choice to add an accessory dwelling unit to their property, or to put multiple units on one lot instead of just one. This should be done responsibly, ensuring neighborhoods and communities are not disrupted and people are not displaced. Adding more units responsibly and with intention can increase our housing supply and reduce costs.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    There are three primary drivers of housing instability and homelessness: housing costs, lack of affordable wages, and evictions. Until we address these root causes, the practice of homeless sweeps only serves to move people from street corner to another. This is not only cruel but ineffective. My focus will be on addressing the root causes of homelessness by increasing our supply of affordable housing, supporting workforce development and pipelines to good-paying jobs, and strengthening protections for renters to prevent cycles of eviction and housing instability.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    What plowing policy? There are parts of our city that do not see plows for days after a snowstorm, by which time we have ice packed onto our streets and sidewalks, making travel unsafe and inaccessible for many. This is a continuation of our city’s chronic disinvestment in communities of color and areas where working people live. We don’t have transit, we don’t have sidewalks, we don’t have clean air. Sometimes, we don’t have access to a grocery store. On City Council, I’ll work to rectify this chronic disparity of resource allocation.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    Denver must become a city where working people can put down generational roots. We get there with bold policies to address our two most pressing issues: an affordable housing crisis and a desperate need to address the root causes of crime. I have the experience and track record of delivering on these two priorities at the State Legislature, and I’ll continue to do the same on Denver City Council.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    At the State Legislature, I’ve run numerous policies to hold corporate polluters accountable, establishing a statewide framework for regulating corporations that spew deadly air toxins into areas like North Denver. Similarly, we must make the necessary investments to create a thriving public transportation system that provides regular and consistent transit options, reducing our dependency on cars and providing equitable, affordable, safe, and clean transit options in every corner of the city.

    </div>
</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    The increase in crime over the past several years makes Denverites feel less safe, hurts economic development, and drains our city of resources. We must bolster youth intervention programs, economic development, transitional and affordable housing, and treatment for addiction and mental health issues. These root causes of much criminal behavior are long-term investments that will impact the community now and into the future. At the same time, we need to ensure law enforcement has the resources and training it needs to address the acute problem of crime that is happening right now in Denver.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    First, we must allow for increased density and infill here in Denver. This includes re-zoning for ADUs across the city, more flexibility in the type of units that can be built in residential areas, and transit hub infill. Second, we must speed up the permitting process for new building. This will involve making sure the relevant departments have the necessary staff to efficiently move proposals through the process and looking for areas where there are redundancies or unnecessary red tape. Third, the city should aggressively look for opportunities to purchase land and buildings to boost affordable housing options.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    Yes, I support the redevelopment. We can have both more housing, including hundreds of units at affordable rates, and ample park space. Boosting available housing is key to making sure Denver can grow responsibly. Targeting new housing on part of a bankrupt golf course with provisions to ensure the surrounding Park Hill community benefits from the development and bringing into existence one of the largest parks in the city is a good use of this land. I would work to hold the developer to the agreements and promises made to ensure affordable housing and green space.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    Attracting workers back to the central business district and continuing to attract conventions and large-scale gatherings are both crucial to the revitalization. This requires making it feel both safe and beautiful. I am heartened to see recently introduced initiatives that increase visibility, pedestrian traffic, and coordination to address public safety concerns and would look to bolster and expand these programs. Bringing in diverse small businesses and retail to fill vacant store fronts, improvements and additional greening of the built environment will make downtown a destination once again. Where feasible, adaptive reuse should also be encouraged.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    The proliferation of guns in our community, especially amongst our young people. The vast majority of homicides and aggravated assaults I prosecuted involved young people, drugs and alcohol, and handguns. City Council has already taken steps like the banning of “ghost guns” and I would want to expand on this work by looking at increased waiting periods for the purchase of firearms and increasing the age at which such purchases can be made. We also need continued focus and funding for community-based violence interruption and youth diversion programs.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    Yes, we need more permissive zoning in Denver and it need not come at the expense of neighborhood character and history. Soft infill, such as allowances of duplexes and triplexes, boost the overall stock of housing and make it more affordable and do not alter the unique character of each of Denver’s 78 neighborhoods. Growth should happen across the city and not just confined to certain areas, many of which have been historically marginalized. Targeting some of the development around transit hubs, such as light rail stations, will also allow for more seamless integration.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    Yes, with an emphasis on offering services and options to those affected. Sweeping an encampment without providing alternatives doesn’t solve the problem and will make it worse by creating more instability and distrust between those unhoused neighbors and city agencies. It is unacceptable for there to be anyone sleeping on our streets in 2023. It is a tragedy for those experiencing it, and harms our neighbors and community as a whole. It creates public health and transportation difficulties. I believe we should enforce the camping ban with a focus on moving people into more stable settings.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    We do not have the resources to plow every street in Denver after every large snow storm, but we can do more than what we do currently. Too often, there are crosswalks that are effectively ice rinks and piles of snow blocking bus stops. We also need to adapt to situations that arise and require more snow removal. When we have a large snowfall followed by an extended period of cold days, even frequently used streets become impassable with deep pot holes and black ice. We can do better.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    Denver has an incredible opportunity to serve as a guiding light for cities around the world and show that a growing city need not lose its roots and its essence. We can marry the need for development with the unique vibrancy of our neighborhoods and ensure that each part of our city is connected via transportation, culture, and commerce. Denver can be a place that combines the best outdoors and nature access alongside world-class restaurants, arts, business, and innovation. I can help provide the infrastructure and base upon which every Denverite can flourish and build this future.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    The city is already taking steps, via the e-bike rebate and energy efficient rebate programs, that will reduce our overall climate impact. Bolstering these initiatives with added incentives xeriscaping and energy efficient new buildings should also be priorities. Building a truly multimodal transportation infrastructure via shared streets, protected bike lanes, bus lines, and other micro mobility options will allow Denverites to get from point A to point B safely and efficiently, while also reducing our dependence on cars.

<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    Since launching my campaign, one theme remains clear—Denver needs a turnaround and leaders who can get processes moving. The remainder of the candidate's answer was not responsive to the question.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    If elected, I would work with colleagues to take the following steps to onboard more affordable housing: (1) strengthen the Affordable Housing Review Team to ensure that exclusively affordable housing developments receive expedited city review; (2) facilitate speedier approval for projects aimed at delivering housing; (3) work closely with the executive branch to provide legislative support that will improve customer service and refine internal processes across city agencies; (4) preserve existing affordable housing units that will lose their affordability over the next 5-10 years; (5) add to Denver’s land bank and utilize investment strategies like land trusts to bring down costs of real estate; and (6) waive sales and use tax to build 100% affordable housing developments.

</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    (1) Work collaboratively with regional partners to build more housing with wrap-around services for the homeless.

</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    Candidate's answer was not responsive to the question.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Yes. I want to ensure that the successful deployment of core services is front and center under the next council and mayoral administration. The status quo cannot continue.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    Denver is at an inflection point. Housing is unattainable, homelessness is on the rise, and many neighborhoods feel unsafe. Forty years ago, we were called to imagine a great city. With urgency, we must restore it. A person's zip code is a key determinant of their destiny; not all Denver zip codes are treated equitably. Let's ensure access to parks, libraries, transit, walkability, and safety. We must create a city that fosters innovation and supports small businesses. I envision a city where housing is attainable and shelter is readily available for those in need. We can break down silos and forge new partnerships to get big projects done. The city’s economy is growing, and we must invest in underrepresented groups. I am prepared to deliver clear vision and decisive leadership on day one.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    We can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprint through smart, sustainable, and equitable investments in neighborhoods–for example, making it easier for the adaptive reuse of older properties. Clean air and water are vital to our city’s future. Enhancing Denver’s tree canopy through climate appropriate strategies will help reduce heat in communities and promote clean air quality. We must be able to move around freely and easily, an essential part of what makes a good quality of life in a growing city. We need to make biking, walking, and micro-modal transportation easier for everyone including broad and unobstructed sidewalks, clearly Work to expand car sharing programs, public transit systems, and adopt a curated, Denver-specific bus route system in partnership with RTD.

<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    Economic insecurity. Workers can’t afford housing, eviction filings are way up, the cost of childcare is driving families out of the city, and the precarity created by the pandemic has not yet passed. We need many policy changes — on housing, on climate, on transportation, on public safety — and we need the city to take leadership of its economic future and make sure that nobody is left behind.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    Denver should secure new revenue streams to support city-owned social housing, paired with an audit of city-owned land and buildings that would be suitable for public development. The city should also: preserve existing affordable housing through a small sites fund and a right of first refusal for the city to purchase multi-unit buildings; pass rent stabilization if the state ban is lifted and guarantee counsel in evictions; upzone to allow duplexes, triplexes, and ADUs citywide; consider setting a higher linkage fee under the EHA policy; support community land trusts; and reduce complexity to make permitting faster.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    No. The last undeveloped green space in the city should be acquired by the city and developed into a park the size of Washington Park with funds from the recently passed parks sales tax. Both infill and tree canopy are important to combatting climate change; building on this space is not infill, and I am also concerned by the creation of metro tax districts and by the affordability level of the promised units in the current plan.
    However, once acquired, I would also include the land in a citywide audit of publicly owned land and buildings designed to identify where to build housing. My expectation is that process would identify sufficient areas for brownfield development - green space should be paved only as a last resort - but I would be open to what the results showed.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    All downtowns are more versatile when people from surrounding neighborhoods - in addition to downtown workers, tourists, and venue and conference attendees - are drawn downtown. In Denver, this means making downtown more accessible to foot and bike traffic with connective infrastructure. Smaller downtown buildings might be particularly amenable to adaptive reuse as housing. Tackling the root causes of homelessness is also part of revitalizing downtown.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    We need a reimagination of public safety, beyond simply crime and toward a definition that takes into account economic insecurity and public health. We need to follow the evidence, which shows that programs like Denver’s STAR responders are effective at resolving mental health crises which don’t require police. The city also needs to treat poverty like a public health crisis, responding directly to social needs with direct and urgent intervention. Many "crimes of poverty" (like violating park rules or public urination) should be reconsidered entirely since arrests and jail time only serve to deepen poverty and homelessness.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    I support zoning reform and upzoning, because denser and mixed-income communities are good for democracy, forming stronger networks of resilience between people from many backgrounds. In addition, density and walkability help combat climate change and create small business opportunities.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    To me, the sweeps are wasteful and inhumane. Moving encampments from one street to the next drives people further into chronic homelessness and adds to the harm and disarray of living without housing. We need to invest city resources in solving problems, not sweeping them away.
    I believe in housing first, which means connecting people to housing without onerous conditions and with appropriate services. The city should also work to reduce wait times for access to behavioral health services, and expand access to Safe Outdoor Sites, safe parking sites, and tiny homes as a stepping stone to housing.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Yes. I’ve litigated disability access cases throughout my career, and the situation on the sidewalks is more than an inconvenience, it's a dangerous hazard to residents. We should of course be thoughtful when changing policy, especially when navigating the air quality concerns underlying the current “plow less” policy, but the status quo of leaving sidewalks, bike lanes, and neighborhood streets as a sea of ice is not acceptable.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    In 20 years, I want Denver to be a city that works for all of us. I founded my small public interest law firm specifically because I noticed that representation was scarce for low-wage and more marginalized workers in Denver. I’ve seen these disparities in countless aspects of our communities, and I want to help dismantle the root of the harmful systems – in housing, in transportation, in climate – that hold Denver back from reaching a lasting and shared prosperity. It's time we invest in each other.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    Denver needs to be accelerating its electrification policies, with more funding and incentives for individuals and businesses to speed their green transitions, and a focus on making decarbonizing technologies accessible to everyone regardless of wealth. I support heavy investment in cleanup of polluted neighborhoods, a cutting-edge green building code, and addressing the problem of construction waste.
    The city should absolutely be more active in transit, particularly in the building of traffic calming infrastructure, creating a city-wide network of bike lanes, provider shuttles and connectors for "last mile" service, and working with regional partners for faster and more frequent RTD service.

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    Several strategies are needed to expand affordable housing that will in turn address the deplorable plight of the unhoused. One is the recent City Council ordinance that requires affordable units in any development of a certain size. As a state Senator, I passed a law in 2000 exempting sales and use taxes on materials used in the development of low-income housing. I support proposed state legislation to allow local governments to enact rent control, like legislation I sponsored in 2001. Homeownership, however, is the best way to stabilize housing costs. I will champion financing first time buyers - many already burdened by with college debt - through land trusts and incentives to incorporate affordable housing into developments around the city.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    I will advocate streamlining the permitting process for affordable housing and expansion of shelter facilities. I will encourage the new administration to evaluate acquiring vacant school buildings and lands owned by the Denver Public Schools as well as other privately owned buildings for new shelters and transitional housing run by professional shelter providers. The city must facilitate wrap around services, including: job placement, mental health, substance abuse prevention and treatment, and child welfare and protective services for those unhoused escaping violence and domestic abuse.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    I have been one of the leaders opposing redevelopment of the Park Hill Golf course property for the last 5 years. As a legal matter, a perpetual conservation easement preserves the land for open space and recreation. The city's approval of a small area plan, rezoning, metro district financing, and a land swap agreement with the developer violates state law; a court must determine if the original purposes of the conservation easement are impossible to fulfill due to changes on or surrounding the property since the establishment of the easement in 2019. The land swap - in particular - appears to be an illegal end run on the state constitution to the extent that the land swap provides an unconstitutional benefit to a private person (the developer).
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    We need to meet with retail operators and businesses to understand the impediments to their workforces returning to downtown and explore adaptive reuse for housing. The city must also meet with existing businesses to determine what incentives would encourage new businesses to relocate to downtown to give people a reason to return. We might need to expand Support Team Assisted Response (STAR) program to intervene with public drug users and the unhoused in front of businesses. Violence around the entertainment venues of downtown warrant implementing a phased closing of establishments or a curfew so that all establishments don't close at the same time, releasing thousands of former patrons into the street, some inebriated, with potentially nothing to do.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    The rise in violent crime and property crimes, particularly car thefts, threatens Denverites’ peace of mind. Denver’s shortage of police officers is an opportunity to aggressively recruit a diverse class of police cadets from our area high schools. Three uncles who were police officers in other cities showed me that neighborhoods respond best to a police force that reflects and looks like the residents they serve. I will closely monitor the progress implementing recommendations of the Reimagining Public Safety Task Force. As co-chair of the citizens committee that recommended establishing the Office of Independent Monitor, I will champion accountability for rogue officers who abuse use of force and diminish the reputation of those officers dedicated to protecting the public.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    All neighborhoods must absorb inevitable population growth. Greater density, the most environmentally sustainable path to accommodating growth, should be compatible with the character of existing neighborhoods. Accessory Dwelling Units might be the answer to infill in some neighborhoods while high rise developments are appropriate to others. One size may not fit all but permissive zoning might offer the flexibility appropriate for neighborhood area plans that grow out of extensive community engagement. Intentionality must be the key.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    Sweeping does not solve the problem of the unhoused; it simply moves it from one neighborhood to another without lifting up the unhoused. And it underscores the shortcomings of Denver’s efforts to reduce the population of the unhoused. A profoundly different and more significant investment of resources in addressing the root cause of homelessness is required before additional resources are devoted to sweeps.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Denver Snow removal policy, like any other city policy, should be subject to constant review and improvement. This season’s early, wetter snow during colder temperatures has left streets unsafe. Heavy spring snows can rely more on “solar shovels” for side streets.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    I envision a diverse, equitable city where a variety of housing options - for rent and purchase - are available to people of different economic means and circumstances. The plight of the unhoused will all but be eliminated. Abundant green space within a short walk in every neighborhood will complement - not compete - with development. A revamped and modified transit system undertaken by all of the governments within the Regional Transportation District (RTD), and changes within RTD itself, will draw more riders. Solving the last mile of transit will spur transit oriented development. I am committed to building consensus to solve regional challenges since Denver cannot thrive as an island. Affordable housing and homelessness are examples of problems in need of regional solutions.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    Colorado’s capital city should be the state’s leader in protecting the environment from poor air quality, diminishing water supply and ground contamination. I spent 12 years on the Board of Denver Water -- several as president. We negotiated agreements with the Western Slopeand suburbs to increase the security of the water supply, advance conservation measures and explore changes in agricultural practices, where over 80% of Colorado’s water is consumed. Groundwater contamination further threatens the water supply and potential reuse. Similarly, the growing deterioration of our air quality will require ongoing collaboration with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and Denver to increase air quality monitoring and protect the historically most vulnerable popualtions.

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    The most urgent issue is the safety of streets. Over 300 people have died or suffered serious bodily injuries on Denver’s streets every year since 2013. It can be addressed by improving sidewalks, improved lighting, reduced speeds and traffic calming designs on the streets that make up the high injury network.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    Approve multi-unit zoning in all residential zone districts. It will allow different housing styles, such as up/down duplexes, accessory dwelling units and even small fourplexes in areas that can absorb lower density developments. It will not end single unit residences, but provide flexibility for housing options.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    Yes, based on what I know now. More golf courses have closed than opened since 2006, according to several reports. PHGC has been closed since 2018. PHGC can supply public open space and about 5% of the 50,000 needed housing units. The number of temporary construction jobs, permanent maintenance jobs and park-related jobs is a benefit is too large to ignore, plus, the proximity to three transit lines benefits the environment. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that land surrounding the PHGC will be developed.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    I think every infrastructure upgrade should be performed while downtown is relatively empty. It’s somewhat fortuitous that the 16th Street Mall is being reconstructed. I imagine it will be completed ahead of schedule because of easier access.
    Otherwise, Denver administration can lead by requiring all office workers to be in the office five days per week. I believe private sector employees will eventually absorb vacant office space as they grow. Denver can provide permitting assistance with conversion of office space to residential units.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    Traffic safety. Over 300 persons have been killed or suffered serious bodily injuries in crashes every year since 2013. That is an unimaginable loss to their loved ones that can also devastate a household’s finances. Designs to improve walking, rolling, biking and driving safety can be implemented as Denver Deserves Sidewalks funds begin to flow. Speeds on arterial streets should be reduced, sight lines improved and video surveillance for traffic violations implemented along the high injury network.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    Single-family design can exist while accommodating more persons. I lived in a six-unit Victorian-style house in Minneapolis that looked like every other Victorian house in the neighborhood. Minimum lot sizes per type of unit can also accommodate population growth while preserving single-family character. Allowing various housing types will allow flexibility as the real estate market expands and contracts.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    No. Several court cases have stated that a jurisdiction must provide an alternative location if the policy prohibits sleeping in public areas. Denver, RTD, the state and Colorado have acres of land around the metro area to provide a place for rest for the unsheltered. Services and protections can be better delivered to identified locations rather than to sites that are, for good reasons, untracked throughout the city and the region.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    I believe the best-in-the-business meteorologists in Denver should weigh in on this. Denver should change its snow plowing policy if the majority say with confidence that weather patterns will change. I expect residents will be ready to move their cars so plows can clear the streets. Also, a brigade of snow shovelers needs to be engaged to clear curb ramps and cross walks so people who do not drive have full access to the public right-of-way.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    My vision for Denver is a city where residents are able to take care of their housing, educational, social and mental needs without the aid of city services. I recently heard one of the top ranking public safety officials say that he would like to see a city where the police are not needed. That’s my vision.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    City officials can protect air quality, water supply and ground contamination by taking a larger role in transit. Brake dust, tailpipe emissions, engine fluids and debris from crashes contribute to degradation of the environment. Denver can better support efforts like the Montbello Connector throughout the city to provide “first mile/last mile” access. Building safe sidewalks to EVERY transit stop is also taking an active role in transit.

    </div>
</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    The most urgent issue facing our city is affordable housing. If we can address this issue, then we can address many of the other issues facing our city. Affordable Housing should not be homogenized. There is transitional housing needed for the homeless to get off the streets, longer-term supportive housing for people who need assistance (like people with disabilities), housing for professionals who cannot afford to buy a house, and housing for seniors and those who wish to downsize, but there is nothing available. Each audience should be served separately under the auspices of a larger, unified plan.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    For transitional housing, use vacant or underused motels, hotels or other buildings.
    For supportive housing, expand resources so the nonprofits who run these can increase the number of supportive housing communities and benefit from economies of scale in providing services.
    Support community land trusts to reduce displacement.
    Rezone the entire city to allow for accessory dwelling units.
    Address issues with the permitting department that delay construction of new affordable housing units or renovations.
    Work with neighborhoods to promote infill.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    I favor the plan because:
    Affordable housing is the city’s greatest need and offering it at varying levels and with a preference for people who were displaced from the neighborhood meets my top priorities.
    Environmentally, the plans call for 100 acres for a park, more trees and conserving water with native grasses.
    Economically, adding locally owned shops and a grocery store will support residents’ needs and maintain home values.
    The land is currently vacant and unsafe. The development will have a well-lit path to connect people with the RTD station without having to walk along Colorado Boulevard.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    The most significant issues affecting downtown are vacancies, homeless camps, and safety concerns. To address these, I believe that city leaders should work to house and then connect people experiencing homelessness to services, enhance pedestrian walkways and transit connections, work with the Downtown Denver Partnership to update and implement the 2016 Downtown Denver Security Plan, create partnerships through the Business Improvement District to address cleanliness, and build stronger connections with adjacent neighborhoods and Auraria campus. Once these happen, I believe the vacancy rates will reduce and economic growth will continue and expand.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    There is not one “greatest” public safety concern, there are two: the lack of affordable housing and youth having access to guns. Studies have shown that crime rates drop when people are housed. To address this issue, Denver needs to allow accessory dwelling units citywide, address litigation issues that are ruining the opportunity for middle priced condos to be built and prioritize affordable housing projects in the city’s permitting process.
    To keep guns out of the hands of youth, I would like distribute thousands of gun locks and hold adults accountable if a youth has a gun that is not locked.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    I favor permissive zoning. It has worked in neighborhoods like Lowry where there is affordable housing next to single-family residences and the property values are not negatively affected. I know that an ADU would be a perfect place for my aging mother-in-law so she can afford housing and be close to us if she needs help. An ADU would also work for my children so they can afford to live in Denver when they get their first jobs out of college. The practicalities of the needs of many others (not just family), are more sustainable than protecting single-family neighborhoods.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    The policy needs to change. I believe that sweeping the homeless encampments as they are now, is ineffective and traumatic for participants. I also believe that the encampments need to be removed because they are negatively affecting businesses and safety and provide a health hazard. My recommendation is that the city should allow for encampments to occur in designated places, preferably on city property. This way the city and nonprofits resources can be provided in those places. In these designated places, the only sweeps will be for cleaning and not to move people who will just set up new camps.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    The most cost-effective solution for Denver to improve its snow plowing policy is for Denver to engage with neighborhoods to expand the snow angels volunteer corps. These volunteers will be responsible for clearing sidewalks,
    bike paths and using eco-friendly melting salts when snow remains on the ground for more than two days.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    In 20 years, I want Denver to be a safe, clean, economic hub. Structurally, I want Denver to have a wide range of housing for all people and have world
    class public transportation and healthcare. Environmentally, I envision a clean city with many more parks, trees, electric vehicles and less waste.
    Economically, I see Denver becoming the small business capital of the U.S. in a worker and business friendly environment where all communities can garner
    access to capital. To get there, I believe that I can build coalitions, garner input, and facilitate implementable plans to achieve these goals.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    There are many steps that city officials can take. These range from transitioning grasses in public parks to native grasses that use less water, to offering incentives for homeowners to xeriscape their yards. City officials can also create more parks, plant more trees, and incentivize builders to use greener materials. As for transit, the city must work with RTD to improve public options and make them safe. The city also needs to invest in secure bike lanes and shared streets, continue e-bike rebates, add more EV charging stations and better communicate why electricity burns cleaner than natural gas.

<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    There is a myriad of issues that need attention to address the most urgent issue, quality of life and the vitality of the City of Denver. There are many tools that have been utilized to address the unhoused, safety, infrastructure, and economic challenges. The most effective tool is a comprehensive plan for land use which encourages prosperity and viability for the places that the citizens of Denver want to live, work and enjoy.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    There has been a significant amount of people and monetary resources committed to this issue. The core issues and causes for the economic disparity between the "haves and the have-nots" have not been adequately addressed -- access to opportunity and sensitivity to the impact of policy decisions made by the city is a start. There should be a positive for providing affordable housing, not a penalty.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    There have been a number of good arguments on each side of this debate. I, in concert with the feedback I received from my council district, voted against the redevelopment at this time. There are many issues - legal and otherwise - that need to be untangled and explained before we move forward with any redevelopment. This cannot be decided ultimately by either side with a war of sound bites.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    Create a greater vibrancy and a sense of place. The revitalization of the 16th Street Mall is a great start and we should look at engaging the pedestrian
    realm on 14th, 15th, and 17th as well. We also need to look at adaptive reuse of structures within downtown.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    The living conditions of the unhoused are of great concern on a personal level. The argument that allowing individuals to camp wherever is inhumane - the ripple effect on the entire community has been contrary to the premise that all deserve safe shelter and a healthful environment in which to thrive. It has perpetuated a culture of despair.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    We are not faced with an either-or proposition. I will reiterate that through
    comprehensive planning and zoning a wide range of city challenges can be addressed - single-family neighborhoods and sufficient density and options to make the city a vibrant community.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    No policy is absolutely pure of unintended consequences but the current conditions of the encampments are deplorable and not healthy or safe. We need more housing models that offer wrap-around services and housing such as the Social Impact model Denver passed in 2016.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    As a lifelong resident, I have witnessed the challenges that the weather has brought upon the delivery of city services. The number one goal should be responsiveness to current weather conditions, which ensures safe passage for the most utilized roadways citywide.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    Denver has become the "it" place due to its attention to creating an active center city. Denver has also created an environment where those who want to build and grow can do so and are encouraged to follow their dreams. Denver has hit a plateau or maybe even stumbled a bit as the challenges of becoming that place have been exacerbated due to COVID and economic challenges nationwide. We must engage with our comprehensive planning with that lens -- not only what is happening now but what that impact has on our future. Plan, provide the blueprint and a guide with the flexibility to reach the vision of a great city.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    There is a wide range of environmental issues that we face, due to our geographical location and population base. The federal and state government in conjunction with Denver are all responsible for creating a sustainable environment. By working closely with RTD, Denver Water, and Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment a collaborative and complementary effort can be employed to monitor, protect and alleviate the impacts caused by our human footprint. The City of Denver should encourage and lead that effort of collaboration. Once again, comprehensive planning which creates and supports sustainable communities.

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    The city has become unaffordable for too many individuals and families who helped build it. We lose neighbors and community anchors every day to being priced out with nowhere close to land, outside of being criminalized when we find ourselves unhoused. We need to stabilize housing costs, increase housing access and development for the most vulnerable in our communities, end rampant displacement, and support our neighbors in maintaining the homes they have, sometimes for generations.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    We need to make sure that we are developing, rezoning, and maintaining housing in thoughtful ways that deter displacement, restrict local growth caps, and ensure affordability. We need to increase the rights of renters, protect against unjust evictions, and support the repeal of the rent control ban so that communities can stabilize rents and give back access to working class, poor, and middle income individuals and families to live in the communities we work in. We need to stop criminalizing our neighbors who are unhoused, and instead prioritize getting them the supports they need in ways they direct.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    I do not support the current plan for Westside to develop the Park Hill Golf Course. I believe that all development should be community driven, and the development plan has not included the community voice necessary to ensure that development is done in the way that is most supportive of the residents of Park Hill. The people who have built the Park Hill neighborhood, and specifically Northeast Park Hill, should be the ones who determine what their neighborhood needs, not politicians, and certainly not developers.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    End the camping ban, end the sweeps, and instead invest in social supports that create access to housing and services that are developed by the individuals most impacted. If we want to revitalize downtown Denver, we need to ensure economic stability for all residents, not just those who can afford a roof over their heads, and transportation to move about the city.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    Denver has invested millions of dollars into systems that are data proven to stagnate, and sometimes worsen public safety. Crime increases are directly correlated to wealth gaps and lack of access to basic needs. Denver needs to prioritize funding of mental and behavioral health services, housing first, thriving wages, healthcare and food access, substance use supports and treatment without stigma or justice involvement, and free, equitable, and accessible childcare and education.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    Yes. We need to increase housing inventory, and one of the only ways to do that reasonably and without significant detrimental impact to climate change, is through permissive zoning. Population growth and lack of housing access are realities for Denver, and rezoning single family neighborhoods is a necessary solution to combat the housing crisis. We do need to make sure we do it in the right way though, to avoid displacement and ensure affordability, rather than exacerbating the already untenable problem.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    Absolutely not. The fact that we criminalize individuals and families based on their economic situation is already reprehensible, but the reality that we then remove personal belongings, leaving our neighbors without homes with literally nothing, is despicable and violent. We should be using those funds to create access to affordable, accessible, integrated housing. Not taking things that keep people warm, keep them mobile, keep them healthy, keep them clothed, and ultimately keep them alive.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Denver needs to change its snow plowing policy. Climate, population, and traffic have all changed dramatically, and city policies need to be looked and and updated accordingly on a regular basis to ensure they are meeting community needs.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    I envision a thriving city where people have agency over their lives in a way that still ensures their basic needs are always met. I envision a thriving economy where every individual and family can be housed, fed, educated, and employed while accessing healthcare, transportation, and everything our amazing city and state have to offer without wondering which bill they can afford to pay month to month.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    City officials should be looking at environmental impact in every project the city funds and approves. Environmental justice is a human rights issue, and the city has spent too long prioritizing development over the health of communities for too long. Development should never come at the cost of human life, and low income communities, predominantly communities of color, have suffered at the hands of development for too long. The city should absolutely take a more active role in transit. Public transportation is a necessity for so many of our neighbors, and the financial, geographic, and physical accessibility of RTD is just not good enough.

<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    The most pressing issue in Denver is our housing/homelessness crisis and it is fundamentally connected to all other issues we are facing in Denver. Having access to safe shelter and housing stabilizes communities and allows people to begin addressing adjacent issues.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    There are many things we need to do in order to address our housing crisis. Immediately we should pass tenant protections, legalize accessory dwelling units, implement rent stabilization and create community owned and developed social housing.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    Candidate's answer was not responsive to the question
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    I would start with safe, multi-modal transportation. We have seen an alarming rise in vehicle caused pedestrian deaths and need to ensure our streets are safe for the various ways folks utilize and access them, not just cars.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    Our greatest public safety concern is poverty. Our neighborhoods and city are safer when people are thriving. People deserve to have their basic necessities met in order to have that opportunity. Access to safe shelter/housing, food security, healthcare and education, safe transit and green space are proven to lower crime rates.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    We should be sharing the responsibility of absorbing Denver’s expansion. I do not agree with furthering harm and trauma by over developing historically Black and Brown communities and causing displacement. However, there are many areas across Denver that are exclusively single family zoning. If we want to address the housing crisis, rezoning and building multi-family and multi-income homes across the city is a necessary step.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    The sweeps are inhumane, cruel and should be stopped. They are also ineffective. We need to repeal the camping ban and approach the crisis of our unhoused neighbors through a housing first lens.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Yes. First, because the current guidelines are outdated. With our changing climate and access to different and creative ways to deal with snow removal, we need to bring together a task force of sorts with stakeholders and community to reassess our processes and develop new practices. Second, we can not allow folks whose access to the world through sidewalks are snow/ice packed, essentially trapping them.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    When I think of 5, 10 or even 20 years down the road, I think of our kids. I think of the world they will navigate. I envision a community centered city. A city where people can walk or bike through their neighborhoods and parks and don’t have to hop in a car and drive 15 minutes to find a store or a place to breathe clean air. I see a city where we have compassion for people who are sick or struggling and we have resources to help them. I see a city that stopped prioritizing corporations and developers and profits, and started putting people first.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    We need to accelerate Denver’s 5-year climate plan, including more funding and educational outreach for programs like e-bike rebates and solar/heat pump subsidies and preserve and expand Denver’s green and open spaces, keeping trees and parks protected while enabling smart, climate-conscious, transit-oriented development.

        </div>
    </div>
</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    Escalating costs of housing, including prices and rents, fees and taxes, that drive working families out of the city. We just passed a requirement for inclusion of income-restricted units in all new development of 10 or more units, which helps going forward. We must limit new fees and examine existing ones for reductions. While people are rightly critical of all the new construction, the law of supply and demand is rigid and the penalty for ignoring it is steeper costs, pricing our kids out of the city. We must, however, adhere tightly to our adopted plans by incentivizing new housing where the community has said it wants it, and where we've invested the infrastructure to support it.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    I've addressed some of that in the first question. Let me expand: We've seen that over-development in vulnerable neighborhoods has gentrified working households to places farther out. Our 2019 Comprehensive Plan and Blueprint Denver updates present a clear path as to where housing is needed and should be built. There was tons of community input, and we should respect that by not deviating from it. Another helpful change would be a thorough revamping of the city's plan review and permitting processes. Denver takes significantly longer to permit a project than other cities, and that adds tremendous costs to housing.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    Yes. Virtually no one wants it to be a privately owned golf course, but that is what the easement specifically requires it to be. Only two other outcomes exist: 1) The ballot measure results in 2/3rd of the land (100 acres) donated to the city plus $20 million from the developer to create a new regional park, while the 55 acres on Colorado Boulevard becomes 25% affordable housing units in walking distance to the RTD train station; or 2) The city pays the developer $20 to $30 million to buy all 155 acres for a park and no housing near the train station.
    Why would we pay that much in taxpayer money to bail out the developer when we can get 2/3rds of the land for free and a new park, plus provide hundreds of affordable housing units steps away from rail transit?
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    With the generational shift in how and where people work, we have an unprecedented opportunity to repurpose much of our downtown commercial office space into housing. There is wonderful precedent for this: The old Security Life building at 1600 Glenarm Place was built in 1967 as an office skyscraper, with the Top of the Rockies restaurant on the top floor. Twelve years ago it was converted to 333 residential units. With the downtown workforce now about half of pre-COVID, unused space can help turn office buildings into mixed-use spaces.
    Along with that comes the need to ensure public safety, transit reliability and services for those living in encampments, to get them into sheltered housing and off the street.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    The surge in both violent and property crime. As recent Post articles document, crime has spiked during and after the pandemic. Criminals must be held accountable, and also held in jail when appropriate for the crime. Denver Police are significantly understaffed and 911 response times have risen again. We must recruit and train new officers selected for their motivation to serve and protect the public, and fill the vacancies.
    We must also invest more in alternative responses to non-violent calls for service, such as through our highly regarded STAR program, which I strongly supported. We must also invest our social services capital to address the determinates of crime in our at-risk neighborhoods.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    That's a loaded way of asking should we eliminate single family zoning. No, we should not. The zoning code isn't "protection," it's our carefully drawn planning. The speculators, flippers and investors like to argue that single family neighborhoods are "exclusionary" and we need to add multi-family. Bull. My southwest Denver district is one of the city's most affordable. It's working class and more racially and ethnically integrated than the city itself. There's no Denver neighborhood where upzoned "gentle density" has brought affordability, and families gentrified out of them are finding attainable homes in my single-family areas. I say, stick with our adopted plans and absorb population growth where we have thoughtfully planned for it, including in parts of my district.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    It is a public health and safety necessity to clean up encampments that have grown so overwhelmingly unsanitary that they've become a hazard to health and safety. There may be changes that are warranted -- e.g., intensified outreach to those trying to survive on the streets to get them into services, shelter and housing -- but curtailing the cleanups invites more decline in a city that needs to get back on its feet. There is no compassion, dignity or humanity in ignoring the plight of people who are homeless. My goal is to get people off the streets and into services and housing. Leaving encampments to worsen to the point of human waste, needles and vermin is contrary to all that is decent in us as Americans.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    No, the policy is a good one even if every once in a while, we have a wet early-winter snow that freezes to the streets. The last time this happened was 2006, sixteen years ago. What should change, within the existing policy, is to assign additional crews to our motor graders and blades to be able to remove the ice from more places more quickly.
    There's no need to spend substantially more taxpayer money sending small plows to every street when there's three inches of snow. The current policy of sending them for five or more inches is sufficient.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    Denver in 20 years will be a city that has a diverse network of distinct neighborhoods that offer opportunity to every resident, whether born and raised here or moved here yesterday. It has a vibrant downtown, great walkable urban neighborhoods, formal as well as natural parks and trails, quiet suburban areas, employment centers, creative and artistic zones, and more. We don't make all parts of town look alike, but respect that we offer a diversity of environments that will attract people with differing needs, tastes and desires.
    We do this by honoring the hard work that went into our Comp Plan 2040 and Blueprint Denver updates, and not ignoring them just because there's money that can be made. I will continue to closely monitor and enforce adherence to those plans.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    Yes to a more active role in transit, through expansion of micro-mobility options and first/last mile connections to the RTD network. As chair of DRCOG this year, I oversaw allocation of $15 million to start design on Federal Boulevard Bus Rapid Transit infrastructure, as well as shepherding the process for setting greenhouse gas reduction targets on metro transportation projects and removing I-25 widening from the long-range plan. Also, Denver needs to work with Denver Water to expand the use of recycled "purple pipe" water for industrial and irrigation purposes, so we can use our limited fresh water resources more than once. Finally, expand our Climate Action office's role in electrification and weatherization of older homes to improve affordability and sustainability.

<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    Lack of affordable housing is the single most urgent issue facing Denver. For decades now, the city has put forth plans and initiatives to address homelessness that have not worked. One data point suggests that the population of houseless folks has reached a 14-year high. To say this is unacceptable is a gross understatement.
    A housing first approach works and that's how I would address this issue. Let's make it easier and cheaper to build accessory dwelling units, expand the sanctioned camping program, and aggressively pursue affordable housing development in a way that does not displace existing residents.
    Let's take care of our people regardless of their situation and acknowledge that the issue is a lack of affordable housing, not a lack of effort by those affected.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    There are several things we can do to address the city's lack of affordable housing immediately.
    We need to make it easier for folks to build accessory dwelling units by reducing the barriers and costs associated with these projects. Increased density will help our affordable housing crisis.
    We also need to pursue affordable housing developments aggressively to reduce the gap between how many units we have and how many we need. Proposition 123, which was passed at the State level, will help and there are a few other policies that are in place which will help, but ultimately we will still fall short.
    Let's incentivize developers to include more affordable housing units in their developments instead of just the minimum now required by the city.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    Yes, because we need to get moving on building affordable housing units. I understand the reasoning behind opposing the development of this property, but I believe our need for housing, in this case, outweighs other considerations.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    I think it's important to recognize that pre-pandemic levels of downtown activity may not return for several years, if at all. With that in mind, I propose we create a downtown that favors people over cars to revitalize it. The concept was wildly popular with most folks when streets were shut down to allow for restaurants to function during the pandemic. Let's create robust and protected bike lane infrastructure, complete the 5280 Trail, and create a positive experience to draw in visitors and residents alike.
    We can also get creative with the use of vacant office space. Where possible, let's convert this excess space into housing to help address our affordable housing crisis. Let's also think creatively about how we could support our small and local business owners.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    For those I've spoken to in District 2, public safety is one of the biggest concerns. I've heard first-hand experiences with property damage, gunfire, theft, etc. In the past month in my neighborhood, I know someone personally who had a catalytic converter stolen and valuable packages taken from their doorstep in two separate instances.
    Roughly 27% of the city's budget goes toward our police and sheriff's office and we still have many residents feeling uneasy. There are simple things we can do to make people feel safer including regular patrols around high-incident areas, more automated policing efforts, and more positive/productive responses to residents when interactions with police are necessary. People are upset and disappointed, let's regain that trust through community work.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    Yes, we need all areas of Denver to help resolve the affordable housing crisis. Permissive zoning is an important piece of that puzzle. I don't believe it's unreasonable to prioritize people over property values, especially as we are working to address the current housing crisis.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    No. We need to stop the sweeps immediately and provide more sanctioned housing areas at least until affordable housing supplies can be increased to the point that everyone has a place to call home. These sweeps are cruel, counter-productive, and do nothing to address the root cause of the issue.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Yes. The current policy is rooted in environmental concerns regarding particles polluting the air from plowing, but the ice build-up this winter is an equity concern. Our residents must, at the very minimum, be able to safely move around and have safe access to bus and light rail stops. I propose we take a look at prioritizing certain public access areas and find a way to prevent the icy mess we've all been living with this past month.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    My vision would be for a Denver with clean air and water, plenty of housing for our ever-growing population, and no abuses of power from our police or politicians. This is a relatively simple vision but I believe it is one that would serve our residents best. We can't continue with business as usual to get there. We need leaders who can imagine an equitable future that serves the needs of our communities first instead of the loudest people in the room where decisions are made.
    I would engage the community differently. Public hearings and the more antiquated ways of reaching people are no longer adequate. Many folks cannot go to a public meeting or wouldn't feel welcome for a variety of reasons, so let's meet them where they are at instead of where we are.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    We need to encourage more public transportation and increase the use of renewable energy on our grid as quickly as possible, both of which will increase the quality of our air and water supply. We are facing a climate crisis and we need to act like it. We owe it to the future generations to do everything we can to prevent further degradation of our natural environment.
    Yes, the city should take a more active role in transit. From inadequate bus stops, to crime and drug use on the light rail, lack of drivers, lack of service to certain areas, etc. there are several changes that need to be made.

<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    Affordability in every corner of the city. This covers the broad range of a person or family's ability to find housing, purchase goods, cover basic needs, and have a reasonable quality of life in Denver. It is addressed by supporting options across a spectrum of need from safe outdoor spaces, to permanent supportive housing, subsidized housing, workforce housing, accessory dwelling units and market rate housing. It is further addressed by ensuring families can earn a livable wage.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    Lift barriers faced by affordable housing developers and ensure their projects have key support. Identify housing campus opportunities that can blend housing types (mobile home, apartment, tiny house) in close proximity to community convening resources. Support community land trusts and partner with them to purchase buildings that the city can keep affordable and available. Fine or tax homes that are left vacant for too long and repeat the DHA Delivers for Denver (D3) bond program.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    I think members of the community laid out a clear vision for what a preferred use of that property is and now present that as an option to Denver voters to consider. I personally support this vision and have been convinced by members of the community that it is a better use of the land to have both housing and retail and a large park, than to have a private golf course.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    Establish a greater connection to the three schools at Auraria Campus for learning and economic branches. There has been significant resident growth downtown, but perhaps it grew quicker than it was able to establish culture and bonds and identity. Residents should have an opportunity to help define the future of downtown Denver. Downtown lost a lot of retail, it would be helpful to look to local businesses and support growth or expansion to downtown corridors as incubation spots. I'm noticing a surge of support for local, cultural, unique retail experiences - it would be amazing to see downtown reflect this.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    We are in a moment when there are multiple safety concerns that demand our attention and action. In 2022, 82 people died on our streets and 88 people died in homicides, 292 were injured by gun violence. We are driving without regard for pedestrians, bicyclists, wheelchair users and we are choosing to resolve conflict, anger and frustration with violence. Interruption is not our response after the fact, it is proactive investment in our streets and communities in ways that they most need it. For example, in Westwood, in District 3, we are building a new rec center, new library, improved community center, better street corridors and supporting small businesses. This infusion of support needs to happen in all of my district's neighborhoods to interrupt our worst public safety concerns.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    We can and should be able to absorb density in every neighborhood and we can also have a conversation about where it makes the most sense and what other options exist. I rezoned 3,000 properties in my district to allow for accessory dwelling units on single-family lots in three neighborhoods. We also decreased parking requirements along major transit corridors. Multiple strategies in the right places can get us what we need.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    Sweeping is cruel and should not continue in its current form. Folks need an option that is not just congregate shelter or jail.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Yes, we can do better about plowing residential streets in circumstances under 6 inches of accumulation.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    My vision is for the inverted-L to be eliminated because we have retained and supported community and not because we have pushed them out. I see Denver as a city that is still welcoming. When I helped build a city welcoming to immigrants, it was because we were already a city welcoming to people from every state in this country. Denver can continue to be a place where newcomers and multi-generational residents feel like they can contribute and be a part of its culture, character, and growth.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    The South Platte River runs through my district so this question is highly relevant to me and my neighbors. Our only parks are those that sit along gulches that lead to the Platte. We have to take care of our river system and restore what has been ignored and taken for granted for generations.
    Yes the city can and should take a more active role in transit, especially the opportunity we have in micro-transit. Not scooters - but neighborhood circulators. We have seen a highly successful pilot in Montbello that GES, Valverde, Westwood and other neighborhoods would love to welcome. And even more effective, if the transit providers were an employee-owned CoOp model. If we are going to spend public dollars, let's really ensure its impact is also local.

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    Housing is an issue I hear about every day. I think the city should be taking a more active role in the development of housing — I am closely following Seattle’s ballot initiative I-135 to create a social housing authority, and would like to see Denver follow suit. We also need to be thoughtful about housing as more than just warehousing people — we should be building walkable, complete neighborhoods with access to open space and parks, schools and child care, quality food and clean natural resources.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    A mixed-income, social housing developer would provide a major tool to produce affordable housing for Denver’s workers. Such a program could work with other public entities, like RTD and Denver Public Schools, to convert empty parking lots or underutilized properties into workforce housing or community centers. We should also be looking at sustainable funding sources, including state-level opportunities like the program created by Initiative 123.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    I do not support redevelopment at PHGC. I’ve been a consistent advocate for preserving Denver’s dwindling open spaces, from my opposition to the I-70 expansion to the successful Yes on Parks and Open Spaces Initiative. I believe the proposal before the voters is a poor use of this space and that if the voters agree with me and reject it at the ballot box, the city should use 2A funds to buy then convert the entire property into a public park.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    There are many ideas the city should be considering, but I think connectivity is key. Denver should lean into the e-bike boom sweeping the city and build a network of safe bike infrastructure connecting the rest of the city to the downtown area.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    Denver’s greatest public safety concern might be air quality. Although there are other issues — homelessness, gun violence, fentanyl, traffic violence — we are all affected by our negative air pollution.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    I believe in promoting more gentle density across neighborhoods. Expanding the use of ADUs is a good step, as well as converting vacant land, buildings, and underutilized parking lots into affordable housing can help us adapt to our growing city. We need to be thoughtful about ensuring a broader variety of housing options, so that people of all different walks of life are able to choose what living situation is right for them.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    No, the policy should change. Sweeps haven’t been very effective over the last 10 years while homelessness has grown, and the city needs to be thoughtful and evidence-based about its investments to tackle homelessness. A housing-first approach provides a more permanent solution to homelessness, and we should be investing more resources into proven policies that work.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Yes. Everyone in the city felt the impacts of the (lack of) plowing these past few months. I don’t have a perfect answer, considering that increasing the plowing brings the risk of increased air pollutants, but not plowing is causing a range of injuries themselves. Still, Parks and Recreation does a solid job keeping their allocated pathways clear — and sidewalk clearing is too important to be left solely to property owners’ discretion.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    I want a fully decarbonized city, a wealth of housing options for all, strong economic prosperity that is shared with workers, 15-minute walkable neighborhoods where everyone can access their needs, with clean air and water and food for all. We get there through a democratic process that puts people’s interest first, through determination and willingness to work toward the common good.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    Denver has a climate plan and a climate office, but the funding amounts are still too small to match the urgency of the moment. The city needs to ensure the office isn’t lacking for funding, and examine its authority to address pollution more directly. The city also needs to take a more active role in transit, especially in creating safer infrastructure to counter the increases in traffic collisions. Bikers and pedestrians are in serious danger, and the city needs to be more proactive in protecting them.

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    Housing is the most pressing issue facing Denver. When my husband and I first bought our house, we struggled greatly to afford it. However, the value of our home to my family’s stability has been incalculable, and it provided us the ability to raise my family in the community that raised me. My story shouldn’t be unique: every Denverite should enjoy the opportunity to access affordable housing, which improves healthcare, education, and generational wealth outcomes. My ability to work alongside people from varied perspectives will ensure that more southeast Denverites are able to remain in the city we all love.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    No one candidate will be able to solve our city’s housing crisis, and if any candidate says they alone can, perhaps they underestimate the magnitude of the issue. I don’t profess to have all the answers, but I know that the lack of housing is having deep impacts on the wellbeing of our seniors, youth, and families. I pledge to have an open door and listen to all stakeholders to create community benefits agreements that ensure the best uses for underutilized plots of land in southeast Denver - whether that be economic development, increased affordable housing, or city services for residents.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    I encourage Denverites to vote “Yes” on 2O to transform a defunct golf course into Denver’s fourth-largest park (think one-and-a-half Bible Parks!) and utilize the remaining 55 acres to build hundreds of units of affordable housing. The Park Hill community engaged in a two-year public comment and planning process that resulted in a transformational community benefits agreement. I work with low-income Denver families, and hear constantly about rising rents, increasing utility costs, and food insecurity. We can’t miss an opportunity to make it possible for renters, young people, and working families to continue to live and thrive in their community.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    With vacant storefronts and office buildings on every block, downtown Denver is not the vibrant city center it could be. Unless we start more effectively utilizing this space, we will continually struggle with issues of homelessness, public safety, and transportation that are overwhelming downtown. In order to revitalize downtown, City Council, business leaders, and residents must work together. We need to support local businesses and renovate vacant office space to increase the availability of affordable housing as we bounce back from the pandemic. Downtown has the potential to once again be the hub that draws locals and visitors alike.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    Housing, housing, housing. Stable housing has been proven to increase positive health outcomes, education attainment, and career development. We have a shortage in our supply of all housing, especially affordable and family units, which has a ripple effect on the stability of our neighborhoods throughout the city. Ensuring that our public servants, police, firefighters, teachers, and healthcare workers can live locally makes our communities stronger, safer, and more inclusive. This leads to safer neighborhoods that can address their challenges head on, being proactive rather than reactive.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    As a lifelong southeast Denver resident, I believe we should protect and preserve single-family zoning, but where there is need in the community, particularly near commercial and transit lines, neighborhoods can help absorb population growth through permissive zoning. A great example is the infill development around southeast Denver’s light rail stations (Colorado, Yale, and Belleview). Above all, we must be intentional that we are not haphazardly building – we must build neighborhoods with a sense of community. I will listen to all voices: lifelong residents and newcomers, homeowners and renters, to make southeast Denver a place we can all call home.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    I support the camping ban, because leaving people to live outside is inhumane. Ultimately, we are dealing with people and their humanity. As a nonprofit leader, I have seen too many children and families who experience homelessness, and our current shelter system is overburdened and often is unable to meet the actual needs of unhoused Denverites - whether they have children, specific healthcare needs, or safety concerns. I support creating safe transitional spaces for unhoused folks that allow for coordinated substance abuse treatment, mental healthcare, and service provision. We need to make sure people are safe while addressing public health concerns.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    We need to make sure our streets are safe and passable after snow storms. With the increase in heavy snow storms as a result of climate change, we need to respond quickly so that Denver public, delivery, emergency, and resident vehicles are able to have safe access to our streets. It is time to reassess the budget and address environmental impacts. The reality of the situation is that any increase in plowing will have its downfalls: particulate pollution, road erosion, or significant resource allocation. We must consider these consequences as we craft a more responsive snow plowing policy.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    In 20 years, I hope that the city I love, where I was born and raised, is thriving, safe, and vibrant – where people can put down their roots for generations. How do we get there? Our city has been operating in crisis mode, but I will work to strategically address our most challenging obstacles while maintaining the quality of life that makes us Denver: our parks, recreation, and small businesses. It is about all of us, neighborhood by neighborhood, continuing traditions that make our city special while being able to welcome new neighbors and in the process, create new traditions.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    I have seen firsthand how Denver’s innovative Office of Climate, Action, Sustainability &amp; Resiliency is changing how people think about moving throughout the city – my daughter is the proud owner of an e-bike, thanks to the CASR rebates, and can now take the Cherry Creek bike path downtown. I want to build upon CASR’s initial success and ensure that the principles of sustainability are integrated throughout all city agencies and departments. Also, I would support Denver taking a more active role in transit by partnering with RTD to buy service and increase frequency along routes where it is most needed.

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    Crime and safety. In the near term, we have to fully staff, expertly train, and create robust systems of accountability for our police and sheriff staff, provide them with the resources they need to be present in our communities to deter crime and to bring violent criminals to justice.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    1. Regulatory reform to reduce permitting time and cost so that we can restore the balance between supply and demand for housing
    2. Identify areas for new, higher density housing that match the new housing with investments in transportation to relieve congestion and preserve neighborhoods
    3. Increase investments in and streamline permitting for affordable housing providers including the Denver Housing Authority
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    This is a decision voters will make on April 4 and not a decision for the next city council. I respect our democratic processes and will respect the will of the voters. Were it my decision, I believe that a very significant portion of the site should be open space and park land. It is possible to make a great, big park and use the portion of the site closest to RTD’s A Line for transit-oriented housing and for neighborhood-serving restaurants and retail to improve the quality of life for North Park Hill residents.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    1. Focus on clean and safe – including providing public safety staffing and resources to keep residents and visitors safe
    2. Create incentives for conversion of older office buildings to residential use, particularly in upper downtown near the capitol.
    3. Finish the 16th Street Mall on time and on budget and restore this important public space
    4. Work with the Downtown Denver Partnership, Visit Denver, Arts and Venues, the city’s workforce, and others to activate downtown, bringing more people to downtown so that restaurants and retail shops can survive
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    Violence. In the near term, we have to fully staff, expertly train, and create robust systems of accountability for our police and sheriff staff, provide them with the resources they need to be present in our communities to deter crime and to bring violent criminals to justice. In the long term, we have to build a culture that rejects violence and equips each of us with the skills to resolve differences peacefully and reject the impulse for violence.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    It is possible to preserve important historic districts and historic buildings AND retain the character and quality of thriving neighborhoods AND have enough land to build the housing we need for current and future generations. We need to absorb population growth in locations where we can also provide multi-modal transportation. If we align land use and transportation changes, we can address housing affordability and access, congestion, air quality and transportation. It’s not about whether to build new housing, it’s about where, how and how fast
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    Yes, we have to bring those in encampments into service centers where we can connect them with housing, addiction services, support for those who have experienced domestic violence or other trauma, mental health services and other support. It is not good enough to leave members of our community living in squalor along city streets.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Climate change is making weather events more extreme, including snow events. We need to use the best available climate science and weather forecasting to prepare for extreme storms and cold and increase the scale and scope of our snow removal services during and after those events.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    Denver will be a true community of neighbors, a safe place where people earn a living wage and can afford a place to live. It will be a city of diverse housing types and densities, a mix of buildings that represent our history and legacy and new, modern, climate-friendly buildings for people at all income levels. Denver will have a robust, multi-modal transportation system that makes it easy and affordable to move through the city and to access work, school, art and culture, recreation and services close to home.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    There has to be a direct, empirical connection among environmental policies, ordinance, and regulations; real, measurable change in ground-level ozone and particulate levels, water quality improvements and clean-up levels; and the detrimental effects of human exposure – all presented in ways that the public can understand and analyze for cost-effectiveness. That’s the key to gaining widespread support for new environmental programs.
    Yes, the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure has to engage with CDOT and RTD to ensure that new transportation projects – sidewalks, bikeways, busways, BRT lines, rail lines and general-purpose travel lanes are integrated into a system that serves every age and ability.

    </div>
</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    It's public safety. I've worked hard to create and fund new programs to address this in my first term. I partnered with DPD District 2 leadership and residents to design a community policing program in East Colfax. I created a program using CPTED studies to help small businesses address crime issues. In 2022, I took almost 1,000 weapons off our streets through a gun buyback program, which were turned into garden tools. I also partnered with Xcel Energy and DPD to deliver two lightbulbs to homes and add street lighting in problem areas.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    We need more deed-restricted affordable housing as well as more diversity in our housing options for middle-income earners. Leaders should continue to fund more deed-restricted affordable units in partnership with our affordable housing developers. I supported the Expanding Housing Affordability inclusionary zoning requirements and higher linkage fees, which will help achieve this goal. To expand housing options that are attainable for middle-income earners, I have addressed this challenge through legislative rezonings for accessory dwelling units in East Colfax and Montclair/Mayfair (currently in process), and will continue to have conversations with residents about ADU's in my next term.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    I voted no on the Park Hill Golf Course small area plan and rezoning because once we lose green space to development, we will never get it back. Denver ranks near the bottom in green space per residents when compared to other U.S. cities, and we know that access to green space is a public health issue. However, the plan approved by other councilmembers strikes a balance between much-needed added housing and park space for our residents. If the residents of Denver vote to remove the conservation easement on this land, I will support the will of the voters.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    People want to feel safe, and they're not coming downtown because it hasn't felt safe recently. I'm very proud of the CPTED program I created, which is also being implemented downtown. We need to clean up the dog poop, get rid of the graffiti, get new awnings for businesses, add more trees and fresh paint, etc. Capital maintenance is expensive and it isn't sexy, but it is extremely important. If we can positively affect the built environment, we can make our neighborhoods feel safer and more inviting, and people will want to be there.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    We don't have enough police officers and first responders in Denver. We have addressed this challenge in a number of ways over the past few years, including: higher pay, more training, signing bonuses, mental health supports, and technology solutions to help fill in gaps. I have been very supportive of these solutions and have partnered with our public safety departments to find new ways to support their efforts. Unfortunately, we simply cannot get people to apply for these jobs. Our first responders need the support of our residents and our state leadership, as well as city leaders.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    Our unique neighborhoods make Denver special. We can strike a balance between adding housing density and maintaining the character of our neighborhoods. It is not all-or-nothing! But we have to be thoughtful about development and ensure that new development makes sense. It should fit into the surrounding context and benefit the existing residents. I've worked to strike this balance by proposing legislative rezonings to allow for ADU's, and I recently proposed a design overlay along East Colfax so future development along the corridor will feel more welcoming, invite more small businesses, and be more pedestrian friendly.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    The city needs to continue to ensure the safety and welfare of our residents. If an encampment has become a public health issue, then it should be cleaned up. It is also inhumane to allow unhoused residents to sleep in tents outside in extreme temperatures. Denver has made positive changes over the past four years, like expanding the shelter system to 24 hours and purchasing old motels to be used as non-congregate shelters. We need to do more to expand options for unhoused residents in crisis as well.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Denver's current plowing policies are the result of a few things: climate concerns around particulate matter in the air, staffing, and the availability of equipment. If we're spending money on plowing, we are not spending it on other necessary city functions. I would need more information on what residents would be giving up if the city chose to expand its current plowing policies before I could make this decision. That said, we have to ensure that residents can access our main roads, schools, medical facilities, and parks at all times. Leadership should be prioritizing these areas when plowing.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    Denver should be a wonderful place to raise a family. We want to feel safe, to have good jobs, buy a home, and put healthy food on our tables. Denver’s cost of living has grown significantly. To help support families young and old, I exempted diapers and incontinence products from local sales tax. I also cosponsored Denver’s new wage theft ordinance, which will ensure workers get paid for the work they have done in our city. Wage theft affects thousands of Denver workers per year and puts at risk their ability to pay for necessary things like housing and food.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    I supported increasing Denver's trash diversion rates through weekly recycling and added composting services for residents. We have already seen a 28% rise in recycling diversion rates. The city needs to do more to reduce single-occupancy vehicle trips too. Residents won't be able to get out of their cars unless there are other reliable and safe transit alternatives. The city has added transit options like the Montbello connecter and plans to expand this program over time. Leadership also needs to work collaboratively with Denver Water to ensure that future residents have enough water to meet their needs.

    </div>
</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    As important as it is to reduce crime on our streets, and as critical as it is to get our unsheltered neighbors housed and bring down the cost of living in Denver, the greatest existential threat we face is climate change. We must do everything possible to reduce our civic carbon footprint. I support Xcel's commitment to alternative energy and urge that they accelerate their efforts. Denver government must grow our micro-mobility transit network that has been so successful in our northeast neighborhoods and work with RTD for new routes and shorter headways. We must continue efforts to electrify our homes and commercial buildings. As consumers, we must reduce consumption, reuse what we can and recycle and compost what we can't.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    I support Denver's Enhanced Housing Affordability program (EHA) that requires affordable housing in all developments of 10 units or more. We need to look at the possibility of increasing the percentage of affordability that we require. The city must look at opportunities to purchase large land parcels to be better able to determine what is built. We must look at opportunities to grow missing middle housing, through accessory dwelling units and increased zoning for duplex/triplex units. We must look at adjustments to zoning that can help lower the chances that affordable neighborhoods lose their affordability.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    I have not supported the bills that came before Council to permit the redevelopment of Park Hill Golf Course. I support the creation of affordable rentals and especially the proposed affordable for sale housing, but I simply cannot approve the precedent of developing on historically open space. I want the city to negotiate to purchase the land and create publicly accessible open space with the money taxpayers approved to expand our parkland. I have said from the beginning that if an open public process determined the need for added amenities in the Park Hill community (most notably a grocery store) I would approve developing 10% of the site.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    The need for office space has been greatly reduced as more people are working from home, and the world of retail has made a signfiicant shift to online options. We should repurpose excess office space to affordable and market rate residential. We should also look to creation of an expanded dining, arts and entertainment presence to enliven the 16th Street Mall and its surroundings.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    Crime at all levels is of great concern, but the increase in violence committed by and against our young people is particularly concerning. More young people than ever are in our jails for committing serious crimes. We cannot arrest our way out of this crisis. We must increase our focus and spending on programs that support healthy adults healthy children, and healthy families. Denver child care centers have closed in record numbers (67% according to Denver Office of Children's Affairs) during the pandemic and after-school programs are in short supply. Mental health care for children and their parents is woefully underfunded. We need to reverse these trends. Job-training/apprenticeship programs for young people must be increased.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    I support expansion of accessory dwelling units (ADU) across the city, though I have asked for two zoning options -- one that would allow, and one that would disallow the short term rental (STR) use on properties including an ADU. Some neighborhoods are comfortable with STRs on their alleys, and others are not. I support a community-based discussion to determine how we might strategically add duplex/triplex units to traditionally single-unit neighborhoods that would increase housing choices while maintaining the low-scale residential character of these neighborhoods.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    No, it should not remain unchanged. We must commit to end the need for sweeps. We must increase affordable housing at the lowest levels of the income spectrum to reduce the number of Denver residents living on the streets. We must increase improved shelter options for couples and families, people with pets, those with disabilities, LGBTQ and other groups previously not adequately served by our shelter system. We must adjust our severe weather guidelines around sweeps so they do not take place in life-threatening conditions.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    We need to do more to clear ice on the south side of east west streets and other areas prone to ice build up. We should consider purchasing some units that scoop up snow from curb lanes and dump it into trucks to be carted to river/lakes/creeks. It would be too expensive to do this citywide, but would benefit certain thoroughfares.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    Denver will be safe and affordable for all those wishing to call the Mile High City home. We will have supplemented traditional "badge and gun policing" with a robust series of programs and policies that address public safety from a public health perspective. We expanded our parkland and tree canopy, and addressed climate change aggressively -- including developing a connected multi-modal transportation network -- to lower our civic carbon footprint.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    Denver must continue to expand the micro-transit routes we've piloted in Montbello and now Globeville/Elyria/Swansea. We must incentivize residents desiring to remove ornamental turf for xeric alternatives. We must continue to incentivize electrification and expand implementation of solar options on public buildings.

        </div>
    </div>
</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    Affordability is the most urgent issue facing Denver because it is the root cause of our housing, crime, air quality and economic crisis. Everyone in Denver is being squeezed economically. With constantly rising property taxes, fees and sales tax, we need to ensure we are reinvesting those funds in fiscally and environmentally responsible ways that promote the wellbeing of all our communities. As District 7 representative, I will work to push the council to reinvest our taxes in building affordable house options, rebuilding our infrastructure, and expanding our transportation system to support our growing city. My goal is to provide the economic stability nd mobility every Denverite deserves so that we all have a chance to thrive.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    I would focus on “for rent,” “for sale,” and “market rate” affordable housing. Income limits to qualify for “for rent” and “for sale” affordable housing programs are too low, pricing individuals/families in need out of the programs. With low income limits and rising interest rates, families often can’t qualify for the loans to purchase in this program. Supply can be increased across the board by incentivizing the repurposing of vacant office space into affordable housing and making city permitting processes more transparent, accessible and faster. This will also support existing homeowners in expanding livable space on their properties, allowing them to stay in their homes and support multiple generations.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    Voters will decide the future of PH Golf Course. However, there was a breach of trust when the city sold the golf course. Now, we have to pick up the pieces and chart a path forward. The city needs to remember that many people have been displaced across Park Hill and this may be an opportunity to bring them back. For the past decade the city prioritized attracting the wealthy and corporations, forgetting about the people who have been here since statehood and prior: working class families, people of color, WWII vets, and Indigenous among others. I believe allowing the developer to keep 1/3 of the land for affordable housing development and returning 2/3 of the land to the people of Denver is a possible solution to move forward. Either way, I will honor what the voters decide.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    Downtown can and should be a gathering place for all of Denver, a space of civic dialogue, community connection, and business opportunity. Some of my favorite memories are of working in and enjoying downtown Denver, and we can make it a thriving destination again. To get there, we need safe, affordable and convenient public transit, accessible sidewalks and bikeways, and safety for everyone. As a council person, I will focus on increasing affordable housing options and expanding resources for the unhoused across the city. By addressing the basic needs of our community we support the revitalization of a safe, affordable, and thriving downtown.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    Drug misuse is both our greatest public safety and health concern. I personally lost a friend to drug misuse, whose life could’ve been saved if those around her weren’t afraid to call 911. The fear, misinformation and shame surrounding drug misuse leads to more lives lost and families torn apart. I will start an anonymous drug hotline connecting people to answers by trained professionals and to get drug related support or report drug related concerns. This line would provide answers to drug related questions and guide people to support services like mental health professionals, detox support, long-term addiction treatment, and education. This will more quickly transition those struggling off our streets and into environments designed to support their needs.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    Neighborhoods are absorbing population growth. Areas have been rezoned for density. In Athmar Park we have two affordable housing developments in construction now as a result. We will also be the home of Urban Peak’s mothership in Platt Park! Councilman Clark has done a great job guiding development and using it to create mobility over the river and train track as plans progress in areas like the Gates Rubber plant. I want to see these promises through and continue his work. Lastly, single family zoning is not what it used to be. It was overhauled in 2021 allowing up to five non-related people and their children to live in one SFR and ADUs will soon be permissible in much of the district. While we move in the right direction, I will also be mindful to prevent displacement.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    It’s inhumane to allow our neighbors to live on the streets when we have the resources to provide them with supportive housing. There is a lack of compassion in traumatizing already struggling people by destroying what little possessions they have left. The Denver Metro Homeless Initiative is doing great work to get to the root cause of why people don’t seek services. I learned from them that for every one person you see living on the streets, three are accessing housing and actively working towards transitioning out of being unhoused. It’s things like drug misuse, being LGBTQ+, and not wanting to abandon pets that prevent people from seeking help. The more creatively we can provide permanent supportive housing to our unhoused, the safer we will all be; especially when below freezing.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Yes, the city should change its plowing procedures. We need to plow more than just the main roads and we need a more mindful and strategic plan for safely and effectively mitegating safety concerns caused by snow on our streets. That means recognizing when plowing the street itself creates safety hazards on already shoveled walks, handicap ramps, and in bike lanes. Different streets need to be plowed in different ways. We need an intricate map and plan for each area, and we need ice removal in the days following snow storms and sub-freezing weather events. By effectively addressing snow and ice events throughout the city, we can ensure the city is able to return to normality as quickly as possible.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    I envision a world-class city, where every Denverite can achieve economic stability and mobility. We breathe clean air, drink clean water, have access to renewable energy, and resilient infrastructure. I believe in a city that serves all of its people regardless of their zip code. Where everyone feels safe walking, biking, driving and using public transit to get around Denver and everyone has a place to call home. My vision is of a city where small businesses thrive in every community. I know what it’s like to work hard, overcome adversity and beat the odds. That's what I will do for District 7 as Councilwoman, I will bring an approach that combines common sense with compassion and fight for a better Denver together.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    The Climate Protection Fund approved in 2020 is paving the way for Denver to become a global leader in climate resiliency. With $40 million generated annually, we need to lead by example by retrofitting public buildings, including libraries and rec. centers, with the latest green technologies and supporting our most vulnerable residents with more energy efficient homes. The entire city fleet should consist of electric cars, including public transit and safe multi-modal transportation. We need to restore tree canopy to clean our air and, lower surface and air temperatures. Conserving water by planting drought resistant native plants that counteract ground contamination in all parks and open spaces. Lastly, providing guidance and support for those who want to move towards xeriscaping.

<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    Homelessness. Right now, the city’s approach is piecemeal and patchwork at best. What we need as a city is a plan that is comprehensive. We need quality services to get the unhoused jobs, houses, and treatment, if they suffer with mental health. Part of the issue is the lack of affordability many Denver residents are facing.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    Denver leaders need to rework the antiquated zoning laws that make development unaffordable and inequitable. We need to work on creating more mixed use housing with subsidized housing for the growing city of Denver.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    In 2021, Denver voters wanted to keep it as a green space which I support. And once we develop on open space, we are not going to be able to get it back. It’s a false narrative that it’s only green space vs having mixed used development. In reality, it can be green space with mixed used development around it. Our goal should be to repurchase the PHGC land and turn it into a fabulous regional park.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    Downtown hasn’t recovered from the pandemic. Foot traffic has decreased, businesses have closed, and franchises have moved out such as McDonald's. People don’t feel safe walking around. People see shows and immediately leave. We need to bring life back to downtown and make it a place where people what to do. To start, we need to create financial incentives to get local business to start their business downtown and current ones to stay, increase shared streets such as Union Station, and host free events in parks such as movies and concerts.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    Denver’s greatest public safety concern is the increased crime around the city. With a police force that staffed at 90%, we need to start by hiring more high-quality candidates so we can effectively serve our communities and have faster 9-1-1 reponse times.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    Denver has a housing crisis for affordable and attainable housing. Single-family neighborhoods are preventing an increase in the housing supply which would bring down pricing. I believe neighborhoods should help adsorb population growth through permissive zoning.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    The reality is the encampment ban isn’t working and needs to be changed. It’s not preventing homelessness and is certainly not helping the unhoused. Rather, because sweeping encampments often cause the unhoused to lose important personal property- such as their IDs- it makes it much more difficult for them to receive services at shelters or from other programs.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Absolutely. Those who live and work struggled this past December commuting to and from work, no matter their method of transportation. As a servant leader, I believe that the government is to serve and protect its citizens, not vice versa. Additionally, clearing up our sidewalks would make them safer and more accessible for all types of individuals.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    My vision for Denver in 20 years would be a city where it’s affordable to live, where the middle class can attain a house and raise a family, where residents don’t need a car and can rely on public transportation, where residents know their neighbors and feel safe in their neighborhoods, where downtown is vibrant with people walking on the streets and business growing, and where we are net zero with our greenhouse gas emissions.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    We need to commit to Denver’s 80 x 50 Climate Action Plan from 2018. In doing so, we optimize energy efficiency in buildings, decarbonize the electric grid, enable next-generation mobility, and improve waste management. We also need to employ regulations and policies that protect Denver communities from the harmful effects of ozone pollution. Yes, the city does need to take a more active role in transportation.

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    Denver faces many crises but the lack of affordable housing underpins them all. Our city has lost starter homes to mansions while making even the construction of a backyard unit a nearly impossible labyrinth of meetings and permits. Making sure we can build affordable housing in our neighborhoods is key to solving Denver's problems and creating a better city for everyone who lives here.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    City leaders should allow the massive buildings they permit in our neighborhoods to be divided into triplexes and fourplexes that are more affordable per home because they are smaller. In District 7 you can frequently build 6,000-square-foot mansions with no additional zoning, but building three 1,200-square-foot homes in a smaller building is illegal. Ending exclusionary zoning will create lower cost market-rate homes, as well as bringing affordable housing to our neighborhoods.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    I do not believe an "18 hole, regulation length daily fee golf course" as laid out in the easement is the highest and best use for the land. The easement isn't just for a golf course, it's for a very specific kind of golf course. That means the city can't just put a smaller course on the land and make a park. Many of Denver's parks were paid for by deals to develop surrounding land. While there are other ways to pay for this new park than development, none have been proposed. I will vote yes this April for parks and homes.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    I am somewhat bullish that downtown office space will rebound. As companies' leases expire for far flung, now poorly maintained suburban office space, the relative amenities of downtown will be compelling. In order to capitalize on this move, Denver's leaders must ensure downtown is clean and safe feeling- with public drug use and unsheltered homelessness resolved.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    Overdoses and public drug use are among the most serious issues facing our city. Denver needs to move quickly to establish “safe use sites” run by public health entities and the Harm Reduction Action Center. Nearly 500 Denverites died of overdose last year - some in restaurant bathrooms to be found by staff, some on the street, and some in their homes. Safe use sites have been used all over the world to quickly reduce deaths from overdose and public drug use.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    I live in a duplex which is 750 suare feet per side, and homes like mine are banned across the city. The folks who wrote this question would have you believe that my home and my family is so dangerous, that if they were permitted in your neighborhood they would somehow damage it. I think banning affordable housing is the real problem. I do support ending exclusionary zoning, a policy that prohibits affordable housing in our neighborhoods. We allow massive mansions citywide, we should allow starter homes too.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    This policy does need to change. I personally have witnessed camps swept one block at a time, which does nothing to improve the quality of business districts or neighborhoods. I will commit to placing a safe outdoor site in District 7, and work to ensure my colleagues are tackling this citywide problem.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Yes, Denver's snow removal policy leaves folks who need mobility assistance, RTD users, and pedestrians out in the cold.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    In 20 years I would like Denver to be a city where families know they can find a home to start out and older folks can downsize and stay in their community. Denver will be viewed as a model for our bold action in cutting overdose deaths and stories will be written about how we solved unsheltered homelessness. In order to get there we need big policies that fix structural problems, like zoning changes, as well as a focus on implementing short term fixes to clean up the city like safe outdoor spaces.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    City Council has power over the buildings we live and work in, as well as how we get between them. I will work to create a green land use and building code. I will work to expand the city’s role in transit to improve frequency, as well as making it safe and dignified to get around our city without a car. This will help folks save money as well as hit our climate goals.

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    Denver’s crime rate has increased at a rate 10X the increase in population from 2021-2022. Using crime statistics from denvergov.org and population stats from macrotrends.net violent crime increased 11.8%, property crime increased 4.6%, other crimes increased 12.3%. Denver’s population only increased 1.22%. Non-violent crime can be just as damaging to our neighborhoods morale as violent crime.
    To address the issue we need to 1) Make 311 more efficient such that property crime can and non-violent crime can be reported much more efficiently 2) Increase funding for police 3) Review laws that are unenforceable and either reform them or eliminate them so police can focus on enforcing the laws that will improve the safety.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    To address this issue locally, the answer is not necessarily “more houses”, because the financing of more houses will, a majority of the time, be with a bank that is regional or national in size. The following items improve home affordability. 1) Lower property taxes. 2) Reform the permitting process to remove time and burdensome cost but not at the expense of safety 3) Provide personal finance education that makes consumers aware of the macro-economic environment and the importance of maintaining savings and investments that outpace inflation and interests rates.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    Not at this time. I would support the will of the voters in that district.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    Denver leaders should promote law enforcement in doing their jobs and penalties should be aligned to the impact of the crime. We all end up downtown for one reason or another. When we do go downtown, we will start to see less negative activity and want to take our families there more.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    All non-violent crime. We have such a strong emphasis on violent crime and try to rebrand it as "public safety" but it is the non-violent crime that is experienced much more frequently.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    I am for permissive zoning if the the character of the neighborhoods is kept intact.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    Yes, because they present health safety, and crime concerns.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Yes. For side streets, Denver should contract snow plowing to residents willing to be insured and put snow plows on their pickup trucks. You give one resident a section of street and compensate them for plowing if any residents don't report that they haven't through 311.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    My vision for Denver in 20 years is a diverse city of working professionals and families that have stayed for 20 years because despite rapid growth, faced its challenges head on and was willing to pause and address the core issues like crime and water quality. We went from being the crime capital of America, to the safest city of America.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    We need to accelerate our lead pipe replacement programs and make their status much more transparent to residents who are still drinking water from lead pipes. Air quality will be improved when people don't have to drive out to the suburbs back to their homes because they feel safe living in the city and their children can get a quality education. After reviewing Debra Johnson's RTD strategic plan and being transparent about the issues and opportunities, Debra gives me hope we can have that for the city of Denver as well.

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    We must closely monitor the effects of the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance to determine if its incentives and consequences need to be adjusted in order to fulfill its purpose. We must also work to clear the backlog of permit applications; this may require more manpower in the permitting department. We should look at how adaptive reuse can be made more affordable and practical, this could include creating finance stack models with assistance available from the city as well as creating or adopting code specifically aimed a wide variety of adaptive reuse scenarios.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    I believe that a golf course is the least best use of the open space in Park Hill. If we can use that land to create affordable housing, address a food desert, and create connections to public transit, then I believe we should. However, any development of the former golf course should include a large open space, accessible by the community and the city.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    Healthy cities have strong cores. This requires continued attention to infrastructure, transit options, the business environment, and beautification efforts. But healthy city cores also require people. I believe we must be looking at ways to encourage adaptive reuse of underutilized buildings to encourage more residential use of your downtown. This should include creating models of finance stacks, the adoption of codes that make reuse more viable, and the consideration of implementing tax increment finance districts. But this also includes public safety People must feel secure when they come to downtown, be it to work, shop, play, or live.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    Our greatest safety concern right now are crime rates like nothing we've seen since the 1980s and 90s. Public safety is a foundational city duty, and if we do not address this problem now, we will be on shaky ground for years, if not decades, to come.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    When we look to add denser housing in Denver, we should first look at those areas that are set up or have the potential to handle high density apartments and condos. This includes transit-oriented development surrounding bus stations and light rail stops. But it can also include liberalizing regulations around additional dwelling units; this is way to increase housing stock in residential areas without radically altering the character of the neighborhood they are built in. Essentially, I believe that we should look at density multipliers where they are appropriate, rather than enact an across-the-board solution.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    The City of Denver needs to more aggressively invest in safe, dignified dwelling units in which unhoused individuals and families can live. Unless we do this, we will continue in an endless and unproductive cycle of sweeping encampments only to see them pop up in another part of the city. The voters of Denver have spoken, twice, quite clearly on this issue. It's far past time that city leadership stepped up to resolve this impasse.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    It's understandable and necessary that Denver has a plan for prioritizing the order in which streets get plowed. However, I believe that it is always prudent to reexamine policies from time to time, especially weather-emergency related policies in this era of climate change.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    In 20 years, I'd like to see a city that has firmly established itself as the capital of the Rocky Mountain West. It would be a city that delivers on its foundational duties to its residents and has fulfilled its promise as a cultural and economic magnet for the country and the world. It's a city that provides a variety of options for public transit, affordable housing, education, and self-betterment. It's a city that is representative, respectful, and inclusive. It is a brave and safe community, with the energy and the drive to continue to grow and thrive over the next twenty years to come.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    Denver has the opportunity to become a shining example of sustainability, not just in the Rock Mountain West, but in the country and the world. I believe public transit has a huge role to play in this. Getting cars off the road not only reduces our carbon emissions, but it also helps reduce health risks such as respiratory ailments. So yes, I believe Denver can and should be taking a more active role in making sure our people can get where they need to go. In addition, we should be looking at environmental sustainability whenever we are adding density or building new structures, as well as implementing incentives and subsidies for retrofitting existing building up to current environmental standards.

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    Climate change -- it impacts homelessness, affordable housing, our healthcare, clean water, and our city’s infrastructure. The climate emergency is already happening, and we need to focus on being resilient to its inevitable effects by having a plan for those who are most vulnerable and working to reverse the harm currently being inflicted on people. When we are talking about expanding transportation, access to healthcare, affordable housing all these issues are intersectional with this impeding disaster, we no longer have the luxury of time.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    Denver is facing a homelessness and housing affordability crises, people are being forced out of Denver to find more affordable places to live, wages are not rising while costs are, and attainable units are not being built in a quantity to keep up with the rising need. We need to expand accessory dwelling unit zoning so more families can grow and stay together. We need to have more first-time home buying grants. We need to build more attainable units around public transit. We must also support the funding of tenant education programs, legal counsel for tenants, and enforcement of state tenant and housing laws.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    I strongly oppose the project being worked on by the city and Westside Investment Partners! Residents of Denver spoke loud and clear when they passed 301 in 2021. I commit to fighting to keep the golf course 100% open space. The developers want to convince us the only way we can get a grocery store and affordable housing is through this project, but we can bring more of both into the district and keep our open space. It is a lie that the land must remain a golf course. Once the space is gone, it will be lost forever!
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    We must transform underutilized commercial space into more residential housing. The pandemic has transformed how our city works and we must keep up with those changes by reimaging large swaths of our commercial space downtown.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    We should redirect large portions of their budget to the STAR program and other similar measures and devote more resources to community-based violence interruption, housing, education, and substance and mental health treatment programs so we are using more of our resources on helping people and preventing crime and less on enforcement of a broken system. We must remove law enforcement as the default first responders when individuals are experiencing mental health or substance use crises, or other medical emergencies best addressed by health professionals.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    We should rezone as much single family zoning as possible to allow accessory dwelling units so families can grow and stay together. As we develop our city I would want the homeowners to see the benefit of this increase in density over the developers. I would not like to see it go further than that because what we are seeing in East Colfax where luxury condos are being build out of character of the current neighborhood is causing gentrification and is displacing our neighbors. We must develop more transit oriented developments around our RTD lines to meet the needs of Denver.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    We need to end the sweeping of homeless encampments. We must support programs that care for homeless individuals with dignity and respect through direct shelter, job placement, and mental health services; while opposing policies that harass and marginalize individuals in need.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Absolutely, we must plow every street! I live in Montbello and we seem to be forgotten in most situations (and even sometimes the maps) and the plows seems to be no exception. If we can send the trash trucks down every street I’m sure we are capable of accomplishing the same thing with our snow plows.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    I want to live in a Denver where people my age are able to buy homes and afford to build a family. A Denver where our air is clean, our streets are safe, and my neighbors in mental health emergencies can find an inpatient bed to receive treatment and are not left with an unaffordable health care bill by doing so. I want to live in a Denver where the developers are not the ones calling the shots in our city government and those decisions are returned to the people. We must fight for this future.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    We must expand key programs we already have such as the heat pump program to help buildings and homes offset energy cost. We must prioritize meeting the renewable standards set for our governmental buildings running on 100% renewable energy by 2025 and currently we are far from that important benchmark. We must create an envelope program that certifies that structures are 100% energy efficient. RTD, Denver Department of Transportation, and DPS must work on electrifying buses. Lastly, I would work to expand the newly created Denver Department of Transportation, to aid in inequitable access of transportation.

<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    It does other issues a disservice to say they are less urgent, particularly because the issues are interconnected, and housing is the most common issue voters are concerned about. Working families can’t afford to live here, and the city has left too many behind. I believe the city should expand its own stock of affordable housing, building on mixed-income social housing on land it owns. We also need land use reform, encouraging denser housing types, renter protections — the needs are many, and we will need all the tools the city can find.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    I believe the city should expand its own stock of affordable housing, building on mixed-income social housing on land it owns, and looking for ways to partner with Denver Public Schools and RTD on workforce housing. We also need land use reform, encouraging denser housing types and eliminating parking minimums near transit, so that we can develop with our broader climate and transportation and equity needs in mind.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    Candidate's answer was not responsiver to the question.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    As a transit advocate, my first idea is to better connect our Downtown areas with the rest of the city. Denver’s e-bike rebate program is booming, and many places around the country have seen a boost in small business formation and success when regions become more walkable and safe for non-car users. We also need the city to work with small businesses looking to operate in the Downtown area, ensuring a variety of business types to create a more competitive business atmosphere.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    Denver has many public safety concerns — we’ve seen gun violence rise, traffic fatalities near a record high, car and bike thefts, and also the inequities of selective policing which undermine public trust. I believe taking public safety seriously means using evidence-based and restorative practices which aim at the underlying conditions for division and dysfunction – like expanding programs like STAR, where mental health professionals are responding to mental health crises, or using automated traffic enforcement to free up police resources for other needs.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    I support upzoning across the city toward more dense, walkable communities, especially around transit stations. We need to rethink our land use policy, aiming for 15 minute neighborhoods, while also limiting grass lawns and promoting gardens/xeriscape. We need to be thoughtful and deliberate about risks of gentrification and displacement, overburdened infrastructure, and lack of service for new development, but those concerns should not stop us from meeting the city’s need to grow.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    I don’t believe the sweeps are working, and after a decade of enforcement, the evidence points that way too. We need lasting solutions on homelessness — Safe Outdoor Spaces, purchasing hotels and properties to provide housing and behavioral health services, and expanding the Social Impact Bond Initiative.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Yes! I’ve worked with disability groups in my time at RTD, and none of them would say the city’s plowing policy treats them the same as it treats residents who drive. We need an equitable policy, where snow banks aren’t pushed onto sidewalks for pedestrians to summit, and where bike lanes are cleared with equal frequency as roads.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    I believe the health of our city is the wealth of our city. In addition to plans on housing, transportation, and public safety, I believe in leading on public health – clean drinking water, cracking down on air pollution, building up local farms for providing health produce, improving mental health supports for all ages, and expanding even further Denver’s many recreation centers and opportunities for physical fitness.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    On air quality, we know that transportation is a major source of pollution. Denver needs to boost its efforts toward multi-modal transit, and speed up projects in tandem with RTD and CDOT to get bus rapid transit in high-traffic corridors across the city. The e-bike rebate program is effective so far, and needs more support, as do micromodal pilots like the Montbello Connector. On water, in addition to using IRA funds for cleaning up lead pipes, the city should be taking more direct responses to Suncor’s polluting of waterways like the Platte River.

<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    The skyrocketing cost of living in Denver for families and seniors is the single most urgent issue facing Denver. We need to address this issue by focusing on lowering the cost of housing, transportation, utility bills, and other essential parts of residents' budgets so we do not displace more families, and make sure that Denver is open and accessible to our children when they inherit this city.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    I believe we need to build more affordable housing in District 8 for young families, seniors on a fixed income priced out of their homes, and everyone else who isn't a millionaire. We need to listen to community and find innovative ways to solve multiple community needs with limited land. Denver should incentivize and streamline the transformation of empty parking lots into mixed use projects backed by the community, like FreshLo, which will combine a grocery store, retail, community services, and affordable housing. Or like the Rose on Colfax, which will have an ECE center on the first floor and affordable housing above it. We can solve multiple challenges for Denver families if we replicate these projects all over District 8 and Denver.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    All Denver families deserve a home we can afford, healthy food, and parks where our children can get fresh air. As the proud dad of two little girls, I know how important each of these things are.
    But that’s not the reality in Park Hill right now, as I've learned after listening to longtime Park Hill families in District 8. Housing prices are out of control, grocery stores have long since vanished, and there isn’t enough real park space where kids can safely play.
    The good news is that there’s a solution. The Park Hill Golf Course has been sitting empty for years since it closed in 2018. But there is now a plan I support to deliver a 100 acre Denver park, 1000+ new trees, 550+ permanently affordable for rent and for sale homes, and space for a grocery store. It's the right thing to do.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    Three actions:
    Activate downtown by making it safer and easier to get to and travel around downtown by walking, biking, and taking the bus.
    Convert commercial buildings into residential and transitional housing where possible.
    Create gathering places for families, downtown workers, and visitors to Denver to stay for more than a few hours.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    The greatest concern I hear from District 8 voters is the increasing average 911 response times. We need to ensure our public safety professionals are appropriately resourced to respond to urgent, high-priority calls quickly in every part of the city.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    I believe neighborhoods should be able to better advocate for the positive changes they want to see around zoning, whether it's more space for locally owned businesses you can walk to, affordable housing for seniors and families close to parks, transit, and grocery stores, or more unique community-generated ideas for spots that cater to the community's needs.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    Denver should be focusing on ensuring we have adequate low-barrier to access shelters, Safe Outdoor Spaces, transitional housing, and permanent affordable housing, all with wraparound supports needed to build trust and relationships to help reduce the number of people camping on our streets and getting the services they need.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Denver's snow plow policy and decision making should better take into account the weather after a snowstorm so we don't accumulate the ice that stayed recently, which is so dangerous to people walking, biking, taking the bus, and driving.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    My vision for Denver and District 8 in 20 years is one in which you don't need to be a millionaire to live in. One where we have abundant housing for all at various income levels, where everyone has green space nearby, and it's a place where families can thrive. We can get there if we listen to and learn from the community, ensure we have responsible development, and execute a smart plan for the future of Denver.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    Denver should continue to empower the CASR office to develop innovative programs that make our housing, buildings, transportation, and living spaces greener. I believe Denver should take a more active role in both quickly developing the infrastructure for bus rapid transit lines throughout District 8 and our City, as well as expand the Denver Connector (formerly known as Montbello Connector) to all NEST neighborhoods. Eventually, every neighborhood with the challenge of "last mile" transit accessibility should get a Denver Connector-type service so that everyone can get around sustainably.

    </div>
</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    The most urgent issue facing the City of Denver is the cost of housing. There are a few factors to include: Creating and training a workforce for the jobs of the future that pay wages that create generational wealth for those vulnerable to displacement, recruiting and retaining city employees that can streamline city systems and processes, creating opportunities zones that prioritize transportation centers to fast track building contracts and building permits. Work with state legislators to create property tax caps and rental cap legislation, helping to reduce the cost of building supplies by creating or strengthening local supply chains.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    Affordable housing requires the cost of building supplies to go down. Affordable housing requires a strong and diverse economy. Affordable housing will require the leaders of our city to be creative on how to cap rent increases.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    I do support the redevelopment at Park Hill golf course. I believe owners and investors should build a mixed-use development. This should be done with the community and the history of the community in mind. There should be smart and environmental ways to produce housing, green open spaces, and multi-modal infrastructure. The WHOLE neighborhood should be engaged and kept involved in every developmental phase. The community engagements efforts should be robust and include those living in the area, those displaced, and those vulnerable to displacement.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    Leaders should work with the Denver Downtown Partnership to recruit organizations that will live and work downtown. We should work with the mayor's office to find ways families can live and work downtown. We should recruit more artists and theater to make the art seen more robust downtown.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    The greatest public safety concern is the eroding mental health of our residents. There is a strong correlation between addiction, domestic abuse, suicide, homelessness, and the declining mental health of our population. There are a few ways to address it: Creating properly trained citizen patrol groups to address safety and provide wellness checks. The principal purpose of these groups is to coordinate community policing with police officers and other public health officers/offices.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    Neighborhoods should help absorb the population growth through permissive zoning. This may be unpopular but could help single-family homes offset some of the rising costs of living in the city.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    We should treat people who are unhoused with dignity. We should create thoughtful and caring policies that will not demonize people in these very unfortunate circumstances. With that said, we should be more creative and mindful about the public health implications of homeless encampments. I do not support sweeping homeless encampments; we have to find a better way! With the cost of living in our city, at any given moment, this could be us, our friends, or our family members. Most of these people do not choose to be in these situations.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    I am not sure I know enough about the snow plowing policies to give a meaningful response.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    I think our city could benefit from a more diverse population. We should be mindful about welcoming a large block of the population back that were forced out due to the cost of living. We can do this by lowering rent and housing costs. We can do this by creating BIPOC welcome centers in order to recruit the brightest, the kindest, and the best people from all across the world, including the people who are not BIPOC. We should decrease our carbon footprint as a city and build the workforces of the future. We can do this by investing more dollars in the private and public sector to encourage and incentivize people to use public transit, buy electric vehicles, make safe and active routes to work and school, and use alternative energy in and on homes and businesses.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    We should rely on officials who test and monitor our air quality, water supply, and ground contamination to protect our environment. We can work with universities to recruit and retain students to work with the city. I was on the project teams that brought the Montbello Connector and the GES Connector, a point-to-point fair free shuttle, Denver's first transportation project since creating the voter approved Department of Transportation and Infrastructure. I am very proud to be on this team and believe we should expand the program to other neighborhoods. We have collected some important data that shows this service positively impacts economic and environmental factors in the neighborhoods.

<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    We are going backwards! Safety, housing affordability, pollution and livability in our city have all declined in recent years.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    Seek out incentives and subsidies for developers to build affordable housing and continue to build housing at all price levels.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    No. First, it shouldn't be considered "redevelopment" because it under a conservation easement and was never developed in the first place. Overturning an easement and building on open space should be a last resort. There are plenty of potential redevelopment parcels surrounding this historic green space in addition to development opportunities surrounding the nearby 40th and Colorado light rail station.
    I'd like to amend the easement to remove the golf course language and my hope is to see the land become a regional park accessible to all Denverites.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    Make it easier to convert existing buildings from commercial to residential use, add more public restrooms, and increase mental health and substance abuse outreach workers to assist citizens in crisis.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    Many of our citizens are suffering from mental health crises, and sadly, finding immediate and effective help is very difficult. I'd like to seek more mental health and substance abuse solutions.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    Zoning for additional units on existing properties, such as accessory dwelling units, should be allowed.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    No, the current policy isn't working. Our shelter system warehouses dozens of people per room. It is unsafe and uncomfortable, and drives many of our unhoused neighbors to seek alternatives. Until we have a safe and more effective shelter system, we will continue to see tent camps.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Yes, in situations like we had last month - several days of freezing weather - we should plow side streets so they don't become ice rinks.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    I'd love to see a Denver that is diverse, affordable, and livable. I will seek any and all solutions to help get us to that goal.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    Supporting a robust transit system is Denver's key to protecting its environment. Our city doesn't have a safe and reliable transit system, and until we do, most residents will continue to use cars, which degrade our environment. Stronger enforcement over industrial polluters is also vital for a healthy city.

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    Cost of living in Denver: A shortage of affordable housing is a major contributing factor to homelessness. Ensuring that we have access to healthcare, education, jobs that pay livable wages, and the opportunity to own homes. These are things that we must make sure remain obtainable in Denver.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    We should be creating partnerships and gaining access to funds from the government and private developers to build houses that are actually affordable for all Denver residents. We need more initiatives, including low-interest loans and down payment assistance, that encourage home ownership and provide equity for low-income families. Existing landlords must have access to initiatives that will help them rent their houses or rooms to low-income Denver residents and receive direct payment. Neighborhoods should be allowed to up-zone if desired so that we can create more room for affordable housing.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    I personally am in favor of the development and restoration of the Park Hill golf course. However I want to see if voters lift the conservation easement in April, and I will support their decision.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    We must take all necessary steps to maintain business in the downtown area, attract new customers, and expedite the completion of the sixteenth street mall project. By turning vacant office spaces into affordable housing it will create more consumers for current business and allow a growing market for new businesses downtown.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    The biggest concern we have in regards to public safety is youth violence. We must get guns off the streets by preventing gun trafficking, making sure gun owners secure their weapons, and invest in youth violence prevention centers and employment programs.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    I believe that permissive zoning is beneficial in ensuring that housing is not limited and workers can share Denver's economic success.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    I strongly support the ban of illegal camping in our city, because it is not safe for the individuals inside the camps. We have to use other ways of housing and last minute treatment for those who are experiencing homelessness.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Yes, I believe with all of the changes to our city's streets and weather we are in need of a new policy. It will only make sure that Denverites are as safe as possible on their daily commutes.

<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    I envision a Denver that is safe, clean, and equitable, a city where everyone has access to a great quality of life, feels protected, and knows they are well taken care of. In Denver, I want to create neighborhoods where residents have ownership and a sense of belonging. I wish to support others in starting their own businesses and pursuing fulfilling careers. Making sure communities are thriving and we have access to efficient resources, from transportation, to the energy we use to run our lives. We should all be able to live a sustainable fulfilling life.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    The agricultural and industrial businesses that are so heavily involved in pollution ought to face stiff penalties. We should confirm that they have strict regulations in place and that they adhere to them. People that live close to these locations won't have to worry about health issues as a result. Additionally, we must ensure that everyone in our city has access to energy-efficient resources and alternate sustainable forms of transportation besides cars. The city should collaborate with RTD to increase micro mobility and provide free transportation.

<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    Housing affordability. Denver needs to mandate more affordable housing from private development or higher linkage fees. There need to be vacancy taxes, luxury sales taxes, flipping taxes and short-term rental fees sourcing a housing fund. First right of refusal for the city would allow the city to increase land stock to begin implementing social housing and Denver needs local control over rent stabilization.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    Amend the Expanding Housing Affordability policy recently passed that locks in essentially the status quo expectations of developers and increase both the linkage fee and mandate on affordable units and depth of affordability. Denver needs to use city-owned parcels to develop housing, change zoning to allow more single room occupancy, de-segregate housing types and adaptively reuse abandoned commercial units in the downtown area for housing. Also, we need to continue purchasing and converting motels and hotels to housing.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    No. It is a false choice to say that in order to have affordable housing we need to develop green space. Green space is limited and shrinking as we develop and once you develop green space, you never get it back.
    We currently own this incredibly valuable asset in the form of the easement. We the taxpayers paid $2 million for this restriction on the uses of the space that has value to the people of Denver and has a clear market value. Westside bought that land under that incredibly depressed market value. They are now trying to get rid of the easement and make that property value sky rocket for them and that is why they are willing to trade us a "free" park and some "affordable" housing. We could use eminent domain to buy the land instead.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    Adaptively reuse the abandoned commercial buildings for vertical neighborhoods. The entire downtown has been built around people who come and go daily. We lack any "glue" to make the downtown a community. Instead of looking for a scapegoat (homeless people) to blame for our deep failures in city planning, we should be trying to create the "glue" that makes a place able to endure hard times and transitions. Commerce and "work" will never be the same again post-COVID and we need leadership that recognizes this is a permanent shift and is capable and visionary enough to plan for a real future of downtown rather than cowardly bending to the bust/boom profit interests of the era.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    Sadly, police violence and lack of trust and faith in police is our greatest safety concern. We cannot even recruit/attract a revived safety department to begin "reforming" or "replacing" the "bad apples" in DPD and DSD. Nothing we are doing is coherent/cohesive nor outcomes based. We spend money to say we are doing more yet there is no mechanism for measuring return on investment when it comes to safety. Cops don't investigate crime effectively, cases are closed because they hit walls and transparency and accountability are seen as a threat to the jobs of public servants. We need a renewed understanding of safety and an approach that is rooted in public health and the protection of life and deep understanding and interruption of violence. Until then, nobody is safe.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    Yes, everyone in the city should share the burden of solving the housing crisis, not just a few communities who don't have the financial, political or social capital to resist protection of their single-family neighborhoods. Sharing that burden doesn't have to mean skyscrapers everywhere but gentle density everywhere can help alleviate the burden.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    It should not continue. The amount of money and police resources we are spending to play whack-a-mole with homeless people is counter to what is being asked of the public. The public wants cops solving crime, this does not allow the proper deployment of police. The public wants roofs over their heads, this absorbs limited dollars for a failed policy. If sweeps worked, we wouldn't have encampments, period. Additionally, it does not serve us well to move people who are hard to pin down if we actually want to case manage them. The service providers express this challenge repeatedly.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Yes. I think there are several ways to improve plowing. I have proposed several process improvements and fleet conversion kits for all trucks but council does not have authority over implementation or planning. Snow is a life safety hazard and we have enough fleet vehicles that we could have plow kits and not necessarily need expensive plows.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    I want to rebuild a city where people can plant roots and plan for Denver to be home for generations. I see a city that is clean, connected and family friendly. I see us returning to a time when people felt like they knew their neighbors. I would love for every neighborhood to have every type of housing and every neighborhood has all of the basics/essentials in a walkable distance.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    Denver has zero standards for the environment. I have pulled together our DDPHE air team several times and unfortunately their only goals are to be in compliance with federal and state standards rather than striving for a higher standard. With most other things, Denver is happy to set the pace/trend but not on environment. We should strive for higher levels of accountability for polluters and higher quality metrics on environment even if the floor is set by state and feds. We know our state has failed to protect our environment.

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    We are facing a housing crisis: housing is too expensive, it’s not located where people want to live, and there isn’t enough of it. One approach I will take is to elevate the housing crisis as a regional issue: first, passing affordable housing mandates in each municipality in Denver Regional Council of Governments; second, working regionally to ensure each municipality meets Prop 123 requirements; and third, coordinating regionally for state and federal dollars to increase access to affordable housing. My collaborative approach will also extend to fostering public-private partnerships to expedite the building of affordable housing units.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    First, Denver must fast-track the building of affordable housing by reducing bureaucracies that increase costs. I propose adding 10 new FTEs to the permit team immediately. Our 2024 budget must provide rewards, bonuses and OT tied to reducing backlog and permitting time to 90 days. Second, I will work alongside council colleagues and the new mayor to map out vacant city properties and expedite the building of deed-restricted, affordable housing. And third, city government must provide leadership in the conversion of office space into affordable housing to reinvigorate downtown.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    Yes. As a parks advocate with 30-years of experience increasing park space and the quality of existing parks across the city, I know it’s unprecedented to have 80-100 acres of dedicated park space donated to the city. The park, trails and playing fields will provide access to a vast green space that historically has not welcomed the historic black community surrounding it. The development provides deed-restricted rental apartments, workforce housing for teachers, firefighters, and working families who are currently priced out of Park Hill, as well as incentives for a grocery store and targeted incentives to increase BIPOC businesses.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    Denver leaders must reduce crime, incentivize businesses to adopt a 4-day employee-in-office work week, and design programs to bring crowds to the Central Business District. We must prosecute habitual offenders committing crimes while increasing the continuum of services from outreach workers and STAR team to support unsheltered residents. Let’s foster the vibrancy and creativity of downtown spaces by scaling up DDP pop-up strategies to include artists and small performances like David Byrne’s Theater of the Mind. Finally, let’s invest in outdoor concerts and signature events in front of Union Station and in Civic Center Park.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    Denver’s greatest public safety concern is the growing sense that crime does pay. There must be consequences for criminal behavior and penalties for criminals stealing cars, conducting open air drug deals, and harassing residents and visitors when they walk or roll on the 16th Street Mall or ride the mall shuttle. As we execute on police reforms, we must also revisit criminal justice reform. Public safety also includes our streets. Vision Zero can no longer be a slogan: we must reduce vehicle and pedestrian deaths in the city. We also must increase shared streets, protected bike lanes, and safe sidewalks.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    This is not an either-or question. Throughout Denver’s history we have done both. Neighborhoods like Capitol Hill and Cheesman Park demonstrate that single-family homes with gentle density like carriage houses and duplexes in the same neighborhood have worked for at least a century. That mix of housing has provided affordability while single family homes in those neighborhoods continue to increase in value. For the children and possibly parents of families currently living in primarily single-family zoned neighborhoods today to be able to afford to return to their neighborhood, we must increase gentle density options.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    No, it’s not compassionate for over 300 residents to die unsheltered on our streets every year. I support the camping ban, but sweeps without services and housing are a failure. We must implement Community Solutions Built for Zero program and have an accurate count of every resident living unsheltered in Denver. We must provide one-for-one transitional housing options for every person living unsheltered. This must be a regional effort. Increasing 10-fold sanctioned outdoor spaces throughout the region as well as increasing transit between all regional transitional housing options including SOS and motels to service providers and healthcare providers is crucial.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    The track record of mayors keeping their jobs after not plowing the streets quickly is not a good one, and I’m certain a similar impact flows to council candidates not demonstrating dexterity in their answer to this question! I will tread lightly. Yes, change is needed. Our current policy takes into consideration historical “sun melt” of cross streets as a mitigating factor for not rolling out plows. Impacts of climate change must be taken into consideration when we forecast snowfall, snow melt and the speed of “sun melt.” An all-hands-on-deck approach can provide the plowing service our residents expect.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    Denver 2043 will be a healthy, micro-transit city with bus rapid transit along main parkways Colfax, Federal, Broadway, and Speer. We will have narrower tree-lined streets, buffeted by vertical parks along major parkways with protected bike lanes, and wider sidewalks in every vibrant neighborhood. DOTI-managed free micro-transit electric vehicles will cut by 75% individual car usage and reduce the carbon footprint for the first and last mile to regional transit options. We will accomplish this by fully funding CASR and DOTI to meet sustainability goals. Over time, creating and funding local transit priorities will augment RTD’s reduced bus service.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    The next councilperson must lead local, state and federal officials to go beyond monitoring air quality to levy impactful penalties to change polluter behaviors. In addition, the city must reduce its water use. CASR should increase xeriscaping incentives for residents and the city should eliminate lawn-only options in future developments, while redoubling efforts to plant and care for trees. DOTI must expand micro-targeting transit options like the Montbello connector in every impacted neighborhood. Finally, our city needs to lead - not lag - in recycling and composting.

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    Denver has a housing crisis. The secret's out: Denver is an amazing place to live. With all those moving to our city, and with the implosion of our housing construction in 2008, we are far behind in building new homes. Fortunately, we're working on missing middle density citywide and larger buildings in the city center where it makes sense.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    America tried building housing projects, and it was a failure. Instead of building additional housing projects, we strive to create an economically diverse community. As of 2022, we now require new developments to install affordable housing in every new apartment and condominium building. We are also changing zoning to allow for missing middle housing. In some neighborhoods, that means allowing accessory dwelling units. In others, that means duplexes or triplexes. And it means larger apartment and condominium buildings downtown.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    Yes. We have a housing crisis, and the plan allows for lots of new homes. In my first term in office, our housing affordability crisis has only exacerbated, making the need for affordable housing even more important. The good news about the development is that it requires at least 25% of homes built be affordable. Furthermore, there will still be ample park space on the scale of Cheesman Park, one of our city's most amazing parks.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    District 10 is the center of the Rocky Mountain region's cultural, civic, commercial, and tourism sectors. It is critical that we revitalize downtown for each of these industries. We are already working on significant infrastructure investments downtown, including $160m for the 16th Street Mall renovation. We have also invested in a pilot that provides free rent for locally owned minority and women-owned businesses to open storefronts downtown. Infrastructure upgrades, small business investment, and public safety investment are all needed to ensure the success of our center city.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    Police are a necessary and important component of the city’s ability to maintain public health, safety, and welfare. That said, we have focused long enough on locking people up to solve the public safety problem; we should support our police by re-focusing on prevention instead of punishment. Put another way, let's get the police out of the business of responding to things that don't need police. This includes raising Denver’s minimum wage, creating and expanding Support Team Assisted Response (STAR), moving thousands from the street into homes using housing surges, and more. This will allow police to focus on protecting victims and other priorities which require their specialized training.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    We must all do our part to ensure Denver is prepared for future generations like previous generations have made Denver welcoming for us. Most of District 10 is already multifamily. The center city is a great place to add density, including in our city center by converting empty office space into residential space. 1600 Glenarm is an example of how we can successfully convert space from office to residential. Additional density must be in context with the neighborhood. This means 30+ story buildings make sense downtown and ADUs (and other gentle density options like duplexes) make sense in other neighborhoods.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    A city's core role is public health, safety, and welfare. It isn't in the public's best interest for anyone to camp in urine, feces, trash, needles, rats, and other issues on our street. It's also not OK for this to be around schools like Morey in District 10. After all, we should set up our future leaders for success. Which is why we're re-tooling our housing options; since I took office, we’re now allowing pets and partners in shelters and are purchasing motels to address all reasons people camp on our streets.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Believe me, it's been hard getting around in my wheelchair this winter in Denver, so yes. The snow plowing policy hasn't changed for decades. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of people have moved to our city, and they deserve access to get around. Also, taller buildings in our city center mean there's less sun shining on streets and melting the snow/ice. We should also revisit our policy on sidewalk/alley abatement as more than a third of households in certain neighborhoods in District 10 don't own cars at all. We all deserve the ability to get from A to B safely no matter how we choose to get there.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    We must all do our part to save our habitability on our planet, promote physical health, and preserve community. This means transitioning our city from a car-only city to a pedestrian and cyclist friendly one. Shakespeare writes, "what is a city but the people?" Getting people out of their cars allows us to reconnect with our neighbors and restore the social fabric that makes Denver unique. This means fixing our busted and broken sidewalks and championing transformative projects like the 5280 Trail.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    Transportation is the single largest contributor to carbon emissions, and we must do our part to ensure people feel safe getting around our city in alternatives to cars. This means fixing our busted and broken sidewalks. It means ensuring cyclists feel protected, too. Denver voters approved the change from Public Works to the Department of Transportation Infrastructure (DOTI), and I believe that means the people want us to take a more active role in transit and transportation infrastructure.

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    As a renter with deep ties to my neighbors (housed and unhoused), my community and I are living Denver’s housing crisis each day. Social housing is one ambitious model to solve it. With the city, not a private company, as a developer, profits can fund more housing. Rent tiered by income means that those paying more offset lower rent for lower-income tenants. Toronto and Helsinki have successfully implemented social housing. We often hear that Denver lacks 50,000 units, but this refers to homes for folks making under $50,000 a year. More housing for them should be prioritized.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    My top priority is advocating for tenants’ rights. We need a stronger rental registry, a tenants’ bill of rights, rental assistance, access to legal defense for anyone facing eviction, and apartment acquisition funds to give tenant unions and local nonprofits the chance to purchase buildings and stabilize rents. Other ideas are creating community development corporations in each district to give voice to community desires for development, community land trusts, and an audit of the Office of Real Estate to determine how we can leverage city- owned property.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    No, but I don’t support keeping it a golf course, either. Denser housing AND more green space is possible. I want everyone to have the same green space access that I enjoy as a Cap Hill renter a short walk from Cheesman Park, but Denver's green space is deficient for our population and inequitably distributed. We also need more tree canopy across Denver to improve air quality and slow the growing heat island effect. The city should repurpose PHGC with tax funds that voters approved for new parks and open spaces. We do need more housing, especially for folks making $25,000 to $60,000 a year, but we should build on city-owned parcels near PHGC already zoned for mixed use and lined for utilities.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    Most office workers are going to continue working from home, so repurposing empty offices for housing is one way to revitalize downtown. I also support having commercial community land trusts to regulate the cost of rent for small and local businesses downtown, which would direct tourist and visitor dollars to our community rather than national companies. For Union Station (part of District 10), I'd love to implement a site similar to the Hub of Hope in Philadelphia, which offers unhoused neighbors a safe place to warm up, take a shower, do laundry, and connect with health care and housing resources.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    City leaders haven't adequately addressed our biggest public safety risks: crime and criminalization's root causes like poverty, systemic injustice, climate change, and untreated mental illness. We should fund ideas developed by the people closest to the pain, e.g. the Support Team Assisted Response Program. The Taskforce to Reimagine Policing &amp; Public Safety's recommendations are data-driven ways to better public safety.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    We must center the most vulnerable people as we develop more of every housing type in every neighborhood. I would consider upzoning all neighborhoods after amending Expanding Housing Affordability to require more deeply affordable units in new developments. We can charge a price per square foot on a fee-in-lieu basis based on what our market here can hold. This would provide more funds for building more affordable units. I'll advocate for social housing and leveraging city-owned land as well as push for more permanent safe outdoor sites, more community benefits agreements on city-owned property, and budget amendments for more housing dollars.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    Housing is a human right. I’m firmly against Denver’s camping ban, and I’ve pledged to my community that I will vote to overturn it. It is inhumane to stop people from protecting themselves from the elements with a tarp, tent, or blanket. Not only are the sweeps cruel, but they are counterproductive and expensive. Violently displacing unhoused people does not address our housing crisis and the dire need to house people. Sweeps cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of dollars to traumatize and move people around, and these funds would be better spent on housing people.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Current plowing policy does not prioritize safety, especially for transit riders, disabled people, and pedestrians. Snow plows that dump in bike lanes and sidewalks create unsafe conditions, and icy sidewalks make it impossible for disabled folks to get around. The city should remove ice from sidewalks and bus stops just as they do on roads. We need to consider better drainage in key areas. We can also explore creative technologies other cities use in winter, like heated systems for sidewalk materials in busy areas. As we improve sidewalks thanks to last year’s successful ballot measure, we must make these considerations.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    My community and I dream of a Denver where everyone can thrive on their own terms. We envision a fully operational social housing model where the city is building and buying buildings so that everyone can afford a home. We envision a rapid transit bus on Colfax and more city funding for accessible, sustainable transit so that everyone can get around more easily. We envision accessible mental health services and substance use treatment, including safe injection sites with wrap-around services in city-owned buildings. As a council member, just as I have in my role as a community member, I will advocate and organize with my neighbors for legislation and budget amendments to bring our vision to life.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    My environmental approach is rooted in the climate justice movement and my ancestors’ experiences. I’m the granddaughter of a coal miner who died of black lung disease. The coal company where my grandfather worked didn't offer any compensation to my family after his death. As with many complex issues, we can take a multi-pronged approach on climate challenges: protecting and expanding green space; funding accessible, sustainable transit options that are free to everyone; saving water with incentives for replacing grass with native plants and xeriscaping; and replacing turf on city-owned property with native plants and xeriscapes, too.

<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    Denver's lack of imagination, coordination, and courage regarding homelessness is its greatest failure and most urgent issue. Denver's homelessness numbers have risen, despite hundreds of millions of dollars allocated in recent years. For the past three years, I have worked on mitigation practices in these camps directly, and I am running to bring better accountability for a housing-first approach that includes data-driven wrap around mental health and addiction services, case management, and community reintegration efforts to address the conditions that lead to and keep people homeless. This must also be paired with coordinated enforcement of our urban camping ban that moves people closer to stability, rather than further away.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    I am running to bring stronger partnerships between the city and developers interested in building affordable housing, providing a collaborative and varied approach to increasing housing stock. We must partner with the Denver Housing Authority and look to creative use of under-utilized city-owned property to champion inclusive development that preserves and grows the character of our neighborhoods, while welcoming a new generation of homeowners. I will work with our planning and zoning office to expedite affordable housing projects, providing below market rate rental options. As councilman, I will address Denver's "missing middle" by creating a pathway for middle-income renters to become homeowners through down payment assistance programs and social housing projects.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    This April, voters will decide whether they want to preserve a privately-owned defunct golf course a mile from one of the city's flagship public courses. I hope they give North Park Hill the fourth largest park in the city and a generation of families sustainable housing opportunities, including fully subsidized housing to market rate options. This development proposal is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to infuse a historically underserved neighborhood with resources to generate economic opportunity, arts and culture centers, and a grocery store in a food desert. The legally binding Developer Agreement and Community Benefits Agreement can only be altered with a vote of council. I will work to honor and optimize the voter's decision.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    The first step to addressing this problem is recognizing it as a remarkable opportunity. As a city councilman, I want to lead a renaissance downtown. I imagine a mixed-use, mixed-income downtown core that transforms empty office buildings into residential living space and where city workers are provided child care on the sixteenth street mall. Downtown's empty storefronts can become incubators for the next generation of diverse local entrepreneurs while service providers coordinate comprehensive efforts to address our homelessness crisis. In addition, I will work with DOTI and RTD to improve multimodal transit to bring workers and residents to the city's heart for community, arts, and opportunity.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    Youth violence has been a significant contributor to our public safety concerns recently. As a DPS educator for 7 years, I know our young people's social &amp; emotional challenges. Our city has abdicated its responsibility to Denver kids at the schoolhouse door, resulting in an explosion of dangerous behavior. I will work to improve after-school programming, &amp; social and emotional literacy, by partnering with businesses &amp; vocational programs that help provide community support to our kids, ensuring they obtain a ladder of opportunity. Our public safety teams need support in order to recruit, retain, &amp; promote high quality civil servants our neighborhoods can trust, by focusing on engagement, accountability, &amp; transparency to make our safety system a national model for reform &amp; improvement.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    District 10 is an excellent example of a district with diverse housing, mixed-income, and mixed-use. It is what many love about our district. Our strength is in our diversity. Let's build on that charm. As a councilman, I will support gentle density increases in single-family neighborhoods like additional dwelling units, increasing housing volume with little impact on the surrounding area and allowing for reasonable autonomy to homeowners to improve their properties. In addition, we must increase family-oriented housing stock, most specifically in our downtown core, with existing and developing multi-modal transportation.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    I will work to improve the efficacy of our enforcement of the urban camping ban. Currently, sweeps do little but move the unhoused from one street to another. As someone who has worked in encampments for the past three years, I know there is no collaborative effort during sweeps to collect data, identify barriers, or coordinate resources. I will facilitate more robust relationships between DPD and resource providers to treat sweeps as opportunities to move people toward stability. With better coordination of reintegration efforts, veterans services, housing providers, mental health, and addiction recovery, I will ensure our efforts to provide comprehensive support are well-resourced and that police are empowered to enforce laws that keep us all safe, housed and unhoused alike.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    All of Denver's policies require evaluation over time. Our climate is changing, and we need to adapt our strategies to combat the predictable nature of unpredictable weather events that can disrupt multi-modal transit and create longer-term infrastructure problems. As a city councilman, I will look to other cities for inspiration in their methods of coordinating timely responses to weather. Over the initial months of my term, I will meet with leaders of DOTI to better understand our current plans and their professional understanding of how to improve ahead of next winter.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    I'd like to see a city that responds to its challenges with a more unified, cooperative, and courageous effort, where strong partnerships between the departments of the city, the needs of its constituents, and the resources and vision championed by its businesses and nonprofits who unify around a shared vision of sustainability, inclusivity, and opportunity. I will work to bring this vision to fruition so that middle-income workers can become homeowners in holistic neighborhoods where elected leaders work together to balance an inspired approach to thoughtfully growing and improving the experience of our residents and visitors. And in 20 years, I hope to look back on a city that championed a compassionate and pragmatic approach to solving its homelessness crisis.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    As city councilman for District 10, my objective will be to work to improve the ways an individual can move around the city without driving their car. That means linking Bus Rabid Transit with Shared Street initiatives that prioritize the safety of pedestrians and alternative modes of travel. It means finishing the 5280 trail, connecting Denver's central neighborhoods with a protected bike path. I will work with anyone interested in improving our city's environmental quality of life, increasing Denver's tree canopy, and lowering its relative temperature. Big problems require an immense coalition to solve, which means the city council should do more to build them, especially on issues of transportation that provide for and link compounding issues impacting the city.

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    I’m running with one major priority - to solve Denver's unhoused crisis, because it intersects with so many challenges that affect the economic and social health of our beloved city. Scaling evidence-based programs in behavioral and mental health, like STAR, while fast-tracking short- and long-term housing options, including SOS and public housing, will move unhoused neighbors along the path to independent or supportive housing. Great programs are already hard at work, but they are siloed. Let’s unite the coalition of stakeholders addressing all facets of homelessness to set shared goals and work smarter together, with 100% transparency and accountability. I will champion a fully integrated, coordinated, and data-driven system of care across Denver to make homelessness rare and brief.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    Transformational change for unhoused neighbors and those experiencing housing instability will require us to leverage every policy, incentive, and innovation available to increase affordable housing options. We’re 50,000 units behind to meet the need. I support reforming our complex zoning code and streamlining the permit and review process to expedite project completion and reduce overall production costs. Offering a fast track lane for affordable housing and adaptive reuse permits. Tying tax credits and other incentives to priority needs. Using city owned land to build low income and workforce housing with public/private and nonprofit partnerships. In the interim, increasing housing vouchers and considering higher occupancy limits can immediately help close the gap.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    We all love green space and value the many health and well being benefits of nature. At the same time, Denver is facing a housing crisis. At 155 acres, the PHGC redevelopment plan includes retail, 2,500 affordable and market rate housing units, and nearly 100 acres of refurbished parkland for the public. We can do both - create a sustainable neighborhood and retain open greenways. We can create the city's 4th largest park and long-term, affordable housing near a vital RTD hub that reduces car use and related emissions, while alleviating some of the price pressure from our housing crisis. We can hear the wishes of community members, who know years of marginalization, and their clear desire to support reinvestment in their community. We must find middle ground and some peace as neighbors.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    As office buildings lose tenants, businesses that rely on weekday traffic are struggling or shuttered. We’re losing tax revenue that supports our city’s services. First, I would prioritize the area with access to human services and housing for a sustainable reduction in encampments. I’d fast track buildings that can be converted to housing. Let’s be future-focused! Retain main arteries for cars and close side streets to create fun, enticing experiences for locals and visitors, preferably as greenspace with rotating art installations, child-friendly blocks with activities, food truck and vendor markets, an extension of the beer trail. Enhance 5280 trail plans for more accessible spaces that bring neighbors downtown. Use tax incentives and grants for local businesses to expand downtown.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    We need to invest more in our social services and mental health services. Not only can they deter criminal activity from starting, but we can foster a healthier community. I am a huge proponent of Mental Health Diversion Programs, like the one in Boulder, and would like to see it in Denver. I support scaling the Support Team Assisted Response Team, co-responder units, and the latest park ranger co-responder program, in cases of mental health, substance use and wellness checks for individuals who don't pose violent threats to the public's safety. I believe we need to readjust the scope of how we use the time and resources of our law enforcement, and lean into behavioral health specialists who can intervene during non-emergency calls.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    Candidate's answer was not responsive to the question
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    I oppose the criminalization of people experiencing homelessness who have no meaningful alternative to sleeping on our streets. Sweeps are an ineffective use of taxpayer funds and make the path to recovery even more difficult for people. We need to use evidence-based practices and human-centered design principles, such as prioritizing encampments for abatement by level of risk to surrounding areas and residents. Dispatching cross-functional teams to offer sustained supportive services, identifying temporary shelter or safe outdoor spaces, and providing transportation to it. By rallying our political will and uniting all stakeholders around proven strategies, we can successfully address the homelessness crisis in Denver.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    This winter, we've seen how bad it can get when we don't have enough resources allocated to snow plowing our streets and sidewalks. Not only is it inconvenient and dangerous to drivers, it obstructs the safe use of sidewalks and bike lanes and has an outsize impact on individuals using wheelchairs, walkers, etc. We all know stories of someone who was hurt because our streets weren't properly plowed. We should prepare for Denver winters with resources, tools, and people to get our city up and running as soon as possible after a snowfall, and prevent injuries.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    As District 10 City Councilwoman, I want Denver to be a place where we are all proud to live, work, and play. I will work diligently to implement effective solutions to our homelessness crisis, by elevating the issue via a standalone City Council committee on homelessness. I will work to ensure there is enough affordable and market rate housing for people who want to stay or move to Denver. All the while, keeping in mind that we need to build the future-focused infrastructure to sustain our growth and a healthy planet. This includes energy sustainability, water management, and waste reduction. Finally, I am going to council to be your voice and ally. I will keep you informed and remain receptive to the neighborhood concerns to ensure the city keeps moving forward.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    In addition to promoting an increase in housing density and transit-oriented development, we need to push for net-zero and LEED certified buildings. As we rehabilitate old buildings I will champion infill developments that rely on renewable energy. My focus is solving Denver’s homelessness crisis, not just for the moment but for generations to come. This means, creating sustainable measures to ensure we are creating affordable housing with long term energy efficiency in mind. I am committed to creating a solution that solves the issues we are facing today and putting in place sustainable practices that ensure a stronger, greener future for all Denverites.

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    In order for our city to thrive people must feel safe and supported. We must through proactive and community-based responses address the violence we are seeing within our city. This can be addressed through a variety of ways that both include law enforcement and alternative responses that are implemented and should be explored to replace uniformed officers in many interactions that they currently have with the public.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    Denver leaders must continue to work cooperatively with our regional, state/federal, nonprofit, corporate and philanthropic community to implement bold plans to address our city’s housing crisis. We need state housing policy change to allow local control regarding rent and other anti-gentrification tools to further housing equity and social justice. Increasing homeownership by families of color thereby increasing generational wealth building must be a priority. Affordable housing historically has always been placed in communities of color and lower socio-economic neighborhoods. We must insist on more dense housing types, both affordable and market be place in every neighborhood in Denver.
</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    Yes, I support the redevelopment. We are in a housing crisis and must densify our internal core, along with providing needed grocery store, retail access, open space, and trails to encourage walk/bike/roll ability close to transit.
</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    Downtown Denver needs to become a strong residential and college neighborhood with 24/7 activation that would lead to increased safety and transit rich areas. Taking the inspiration and vibrancy of Boston and their downtown with an education focused mission both traditional and trade, along with workforce development that leads to careers we would create a strong foundation for our city. Density in residential through re-purposing vacant office space co-op’s would give rise to our next evolution as the Queen City of the Plains. Artist and maker spaces along with shared restaurant commercial kitchen space would foster those next diverse entrepreneurs who embody Denver’s diversity and culture.
</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    Youth gun violence, along with domestic violence are eroding away at the fabric of our neighborhoods. We must provide expanded youth and community resources to provide positive support to mitigate youth violence. Our families are struggling, and mental health, stress, and trauma responses bring many different layers into our family and community dynamics, and we must support safety and healing for our health.
</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    We must look at updating our local zoning and permitting to create more housing of all types which means ending exclusionary zoning. Every neighborhood needs to be available to various types of housing and any zoning or policy that impedes that needs to be changed.
</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    Denver must maintain the full passage of our right of ways for health and safety and that includes sidewalks that provide passage for all. We must encourage strong regional partnerships and expanded service providers to encourage people experiencing homelessness to accept assistance and a housing first model is necessary to accomplish that. I fully support any ideas and policy solutions to get folks housed. Safe Outdoor Spaces are effective and I’m happy to support the one at my office off Peoria in Montbello. We need to look at more low barrier opportunities to get folks housed.
</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    No. Good governance means decisions are made based on research, data and facts. Listening to all stakeholders and then discussing solutions and coming to the best consensus that results in positive outcomes with the least unintended consequences. It is clear that Denver residents are not happy with the current process but in order to increase it that would entail additional monetary resources to make that happen and that means that another city service may be affected. There are climate and air pollution considerations along with significant staffing vacancies currently in the city.
</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    I envision a Denver in 20 years that is a vibrant, community driven, holistic city that embraces our diversity, adventure loving spirit, and self-determination. I’ve grown up in Denver. She is woven into my DNA and I care about her deeply. My husband and I had our first date on the 16th Street Mall at the Paramount Cafe, taught kids to fish at Lilly Pad Pond in Wash Park and made our home in Montbello and raised our three children. I want a Denver that enables young people to buy homes, to put down roots and create strong foundations for our neighborhoods.
</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    Absolutely, the city must take a more active role in transit. We must ensure that we have access to bus, bike, and pedestrian friendly transit options in addition to ensuring safe infrastructure that reduces traffic congestion. Denver must embark on an outreach and education campaign to ensure that Denver residents fully understand the current climate status and the urgency to enact better conservation and preservation tactics to ensure a safe environment, including air, water, and soil through policy solutions.
</div>
