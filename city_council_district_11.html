<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
In order for our city to thrive people must feel safe and supported. We must through proactive and community-based responses address the violence we are seeing within our city. This can be addressed through a variety of ways that both include law enforcement and alternative responses that are implemented and should be explored to replace uniformed officers in many interactions that they currently have with the public.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
Denver leaders must continue to work cooperatively with our regional, state/federal, nonprofit, corporate and philanthropic community to implement bold plans to address our city’s housing crisis. We need state housing policy change to allow local control regarding rent and other anti-gentrification tools to further housing equity and social justice. Increasing homeownership by families of color thereby increasing generational wealth building must be a priority. Affordable housing historically has always been placed in communities of color and lower socio-economic neighborhoods. We must insist on more dense housing types, both affordable and market be in every neighborhood in Denver.</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
Yes, I support the redevelopment. We are in a housing crisis and must densify our internal core, along with providing needed grocery store, retail access, open space, and trails to encourage walk/bike/roll ability close to transit.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
Downtown Denver needs to become a strong residential and college neighborhood with 24/7 activation that would lead to increased safety and transit-rich areas. Taking the inspiration and vibrancy of Boston and its downtown with an education-focused mission both traditional and trade, along with workforce development that leads to careers we would create a strong foundation for our city. Density in residential through re-purposing vacant office space co-op’s would give rise to our next evolution as the Queen City of the Plains. Artist and maker spaces along with shared restaurant commercial kitchen space would foster those next diverse entrepreneurs who embody Denver’s diversity and culture.</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
Youth gun violence, along with domestic violence are eroding away at the fabric of our neighborhoods. We must provide expanded youth and community resources to provide positive support to mitigate youth violence. Our families are struggling, and mental health, stress, and trauma responses bring many different layers into our family and community dynamics, and we must support safety and healing for our health.</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
We must look at updating our local zoning and permitting to create more housing of all types which means ending exclusionary zoning. Every neighborhood needs to be available to various types of housing and any zoning or policy that impedes that needs to be changed.</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
Denver must maintain the full passage of our right of ways for health and safety and that includes sidewalks that provide passage for all. We must encourage strong regional partnerships and expanded service providers to encourage people experiencing homelessness to accept assistance and a housing first model is necessary to accomplish that. I fully support any ideas and policy solutions to get folks housed. Safe Outdoor Spaces are effective and I’m happy to support the one at my office off Peoria in Montbello. We need to look at more low-barrier opportunities to get folks housed.</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
No. Good governance means decisions are made based on research, data and facts. Listening to all stakeholders and then discussing solutions and coming to the best consensus that results in positive outcomes with the least unintended consequences. It is clear that Denver residents are not happy with the current process but in order to increase it that would entail additional monetary resources to make that happen and that means that another city service may be affected. There are climate and air pollution considerations along with significant staffing vacancies currently in the city.</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
I envision a Denver in 20 years that is a vibrant, community-driven, holistic city that embraces our diversity, adventure-loving spirit, and self-determination. I’ve grown up in Denver. She is woven into my DNA and I care about her deeply. My husband and I had our first date on the 16th Street Mall at the Paramount Cafe, taught kids to fish at Lilly Pad Pond in Wash Park and made our home in Montbello and raised our three children. I want a Denver that enables young people to buy homes, to put down roots and create strong foundations for our neighborhoods.</div>
<p></p><p></p><p></p>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
Absolutely, the city must take a more active role in transit. We must ensure that we have access to bus, bike, and pedestrian-friendly transit options in addition to ensuring safe infrastructure that reduces traffic congestion. Denver must embark on an outreach and education campaign to ensure that Denver residents fully understand the current climate status and the urgency to enact better conservation and preservation tactics to ensure a safe environment, including air, water, and soil through policy solutions.</div>
