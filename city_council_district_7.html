<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
Affordability is the most urgent issue facing Denver because it is the root cause of our housing, crime, air quality and economic crisis. Everyone in Denver is being squeezed economically. With constantly rising property taxes, fees and sales tax, we need to ensure we are reinvesting those funds in fiscally and environmentally responsible ways that promote the wellbeing of all our communities. As District 7 representative, I will work to push the council to reinvest our taxes in building affordable house options, rebuilding our infrastructure, and expanding our transportation system to support our growing city. My goal is to provide the economic stability nd mobility every Denverite deserves so that we all have a chance to thrive.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
I would focus on “for rent,” “for sale,” and “market rate” affordable housing. Income limits to qualify for “for rent” and “for sale” affordable housing programs are too low, pricing individuals/families in need out of the programs. With low-income limits and rising interest rates, families often can’t qualify for the loans to purchase in this program. Supply can be increased across the board by incentivizing the repurposing of vacant office space into affordable housing and making city permitting processes more transparent, accessible and faster. This will also support existing homeowners in expanding livable space on their properties, allowing them to stay in their homes and support multiple generations.</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
Voters will decide the future of PH Golf Course. However, there was a breach of trust when the city sold the golf course. Now, we have to pick up the pieces and chart a path forward. The city needs to remember that many people have been displaced across Park Hill and this may be an opportunity to bring them back. For the past decade the city prioritized attracting the wealthy and corporations, forgetting about the people who have been here since statehood and prior: working class families, people of color, WWII vets, and Indigenous among others. I believe allowing the developer to keep 1/3 of the land for affordable housing development and returning 2/3 of the land to the people of Denver is a possible solution to move forward. Either way, I will honor what the voters decide.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
Downtown can and should be a gathering place for all of Denver, a space of civic dialogue, community connection, and business opportunity. Some of my favorite memories are of working in and enjoying downtown Denver, and we can make it a thriving destination again. To get there, we need safe, affordable and convenient public transit, accessible sidewalks and bikeways, and safety for everyone. As a council person, I will focus on increasing affordable housing options and expanding resources for the unhoused across the city. By addressing the basic needs of our community we support the revitalization of a safe, affordable, and thriving downtown.</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
Drug misuse is both our greatest public safety and health concern. I personally lost a friend to drug misuse, whose life could’ve been saved if those around her weren’t afraid to call 911. The fear, misinformation and shame surrounding drug misuse leads to more lives lost and families torn apart. I will start an anonymous drug hotline connecting people to answers by trained professionals and to get drug-related support or report drug-related concerns. This line would provide answers to drug-related questions and guide people to support services like mental health professionals, detox support, long-term addiction treatment, and education. This will more quickly transition those struggling off our streets and into environments designed to support their needs.</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
Neighborhoods are absorbing population growth. Areas have been rezoned for density. In Athmar Park we have two affordable housing developments in construction now as a result. We will also be the home of Urban Peak’s mothership in Platt Park! Councilman Clark has done a great job guiding development and using it to create mobility over the river and train track as plans progress in areas like the Gates Rubber plant. I want to see these promises through and continue his work. Lastly, single-family zoning is not what it used to be. It was overhauled in 2021 allowing up to five non-related people and their children to live in one SFR and ADUs will soon be permissible in much of the district. While we move in the right direction, I will also be mindful to prevent displacement.</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
It’s inhumane to allow our neighbors to live on the streets when we have the resources to provide them with supportive housing. There is a lack of compassion in traumatizing already struggling people by destroying what little possessions they have left. The Denver Metro Homeless Initiative is doing great work to get to the root cause of why people don’t seek services. I learned from them that for every one person you see living on the streets, three are accessing housing and actively working towards transitioning out of being unhoused. It’s things like drug misuse, being LGBTQ+, and not wanting to abandon pets that prevent people from seeking help. The more creatively we can provide permanent supportive housing to our unhoused, the safer we will all be; especially when below freezing.</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
Yes, the city should change its plowing procedures. We need to plow more than just the main roads and we need a more mindful and strategic plan for safely and effectively mitigating safety concerns caused by snow on our streets. That means recognizing when plowing the street itself creates safety hazards on already shoveled walks, handicap ramps, and in bike lanes. Different streets need to be plowed in different ways. We need an intricate map and plan for each area, and we need ice removal in the days following snow storms and sub-freezing weather events. By effectively addressing snow and ice events throughout the city, we can ensure the city is able to return to normality as quickly as possible.</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
I envision a world-class city, where every Denverite can achieve economic stability and mobility. We breathe clean air, drink clean water, have access to renewable energy, and resilient infrastructure. I believe in a city that serves all of its people regardless of their zip code. Where everyone feels safe walking, biking, driving and using public transit to get around Denver and everyone has a place to call home. My vision is of a city where small businesses thrive in every community. I know what it’s like to work hard, overcome adversity and beat the odds. That's what I will do for District 7 as Councilwoman, I will bring an approach that combines common sense with compassion and fight for a better Denver together.</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
The Climate Protection Fund approved in 2020 is paving the way for Denver to become a global leader in climate resiliency. With $40 million generated annually, we need to lead by example by retrofitting public buildings, including libraries and rec. centers, with the latest green technologies and supporting our most vulnerable residents with more energy-efficient homes. The entire city fleet should consist of electric cars, including public transit and safe multi-modal transportation. We need to restore tree canopy to clean our air and, lower surface and air temperatures. Conserving water by planting drought-resistant native plants that counteract ground contamination in all parks and open spaces. Lastly, providing guidance and support for those who want to move towards xeriscaping.</div>

</div>
</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
Homelessness. Right now, the city’s approach is piecemeal and patchwork at best. What we need as a city is a plan that is comprehensive. We need quality services to get the unhoused jobs, houses, and treatment, if they suffer with mental health problems. Part of the issue is the lack of affordability many Denver residents are facing.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
Denver leaders need to rework the antiquated zoning laws that make development unaffordable and inequitable. We need to work on creating more mixed use housing with subsidized housing for the growing city of Denver.</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
In 2021, Denver voters wanted to keep it as a green space which I support. And once we develop on open space, we are not going to be able to get it back. It’s a false narrative that it’s only green space vs having mixed used development. In reality, it can be green space with mixed used development around it. Our goal should be to repurchase the PHGC land and turn it into a fabulous regional park.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
Downtown hasn’t recovered from the pandemic. Foot traffic has decreased, businesses have closed, and franchises have moved out such as McDonald's. People don’t feel safe walking around. People see shows and immediately leave. We need to bring life back to downtown and make it a place where people what to do. To start, we need to create financial incentives to get local business to start their business downtown and current ones to stay, increase shared streets such as Union Station, and host free events in parks such as movies and concerts.</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
Denver’s greatest public safety concern is the increased crime around the city. With a police force that staffed at 90%, we need to start by hiring more high-quality candidates so we can effectively serve our communities and have faster 9-1-1 response times.</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
Denver has a housing crisis for affordable and attainable housing. Single-family neighborhoods are preventing an increase in the housing supply which would bring down pricing. I believe neighborhoods should help adsorb population growth through permissive zoning.</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
The reality is the encampment ban isn’t working and needs to be changed. It’s not preventing homelessness and is certainly not helping the unhoused. Rather, because sweeping encampments often cause the unhoused to lose important personal property- such as their IDs- it makes it much more difficult for them to receive services at shelters or from other programs.</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
Absolutely. Those who live and work struggled this past December commuting to and from work, no matter their method of transportation. As a servant leader, I believe that the government is to serve and protect its citizens, not vice versa. Additionally, clearing up our sidewalks would make them safer and more accessible for all types of individuals.</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
My vision for Denver in 20 years would be a city where it’s affordable to live, where the middle class can attain a house and raise a family, where residents don’t need a car and can rely on public transportation, where residents know their neighbors and feel safe in their neighborhoods, where downtown is vibrant with people walking on the streets and business growing, and where we are net zero with our greenhouse gas emissions.</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
We need to commit to Denver’s 80 x 50 Climate Action Plan from 2018. In doing so, we optimize energy efficiency in buildings, decarbonize the electric grid, enable next-generation mobility, and improve waste management. We also need to employ regulations and policies that protect Denver communities from the harmful effects of ozone pollution. Yes, the city does need to take a more active role in transportation.</div>

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
Denver faces many crises but the lack of affordable housing underpins them all. Our city has lost starter homes to mansions while making even the construction of a backyard unit a nearly impossible labyrinth of meetings and permits. Making sure we can build affordable housing in our neighborhoods is key to solving Denver's problems and creating a better city for everyone who lives here.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
City leaders should allow the massive buildings they permit in our neighborhoods to be divided into triplexes and fourplexes that are more affordable per home because they are smaller. In District 7 you can frequently build 6,000-square-foot mansions with no additional zoning, but building three 1,200-square-foot homes in a smaller building is illegal. Ending exclusionary zoning will create lower cost market-rate homes, as well as bringing affordable housing to our neighborhoods.</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
I do not believe an "18 hole, regulation length daily fee golf course" as laid out in the easement is the highest and best use for the land. The easement isn't just for a golf course, it's for a very specific kind of golf course. That means the city can't just put a smaller course on the land and make a park. Many of Denver's parks were paid for by deals to develop surrounding land. While there are other ways to pay for this new park than development, none have been proposed. I will vote yes this April for parks and homes.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
I am somewhat bullish that downtown office space will rebound. As companies' leases expire for far flung, now poorly maintained suburban office space, the relative amenities of downtown will be compelling. In order to capitalize on this move, Denver's leaders must ensure downtown is clean and safe feeling- with public drug use and unsheltered homelessness resolved.</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
Overdoses and public drug use are among the most serious issues facing our city. Denver needs to move quickly to establish “safe use sites” run by public health entities and the Harm Reduction Action Center. Nearly 500 Denverites died of overdose last year - some in restaurant bathrooms to be found by staff, some on the street, and some in their homes. Safe use sites have been used all over the world to quickly reduce deaths from overdose and public drug use.</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
I live in a duplex which is 750 square feet per side, and homes like mine are banned across the city. The folks who wrote this question would have you believe that my home and my family is so dangerous, that if they were permitted in your neighborhood they would somehow damage it. I think banning affordable housing is the real problem. I do support ending exclusionary zoning, a policy that prohibits affordable housing in our neighborhoods. We allow massive mansions citywide, we should allow starter homes too.</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
This policy does need to change. I personally have witnessed camps swept one block at a time, which does nothing to improve the quality of business districts or neighborhoods. I will commit to placing a safe outdoor site in District 7, and work to ensure my colleagues are tackling this citywide problem.</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
Yes, Denver's snow removal policy leaves folks who need mobility assistance, RTD users, and pedestrians out in the cold.</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
In 20 years I would like Denver to be a city where families know they can find a home to start out and older folks can downsize and stay in their community. Denver will be viewed as a model for our bold action in cutting overdose deaths and stories will be written about how we solved unsheltered homelessness. In order to get there we need big policies that fix structural problems, like zoning changes, as well as a focus on implementing short term fixes to clean up the city like safe outdoor spaces.</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
City Council has power over the buildings we live and work in, as well as how we get between them. I will work to create a green land use and building code. I will work to expand the city’s role in transit to improve frequency, as well as making it safe and dignified to get around our city without a car. This will help folks save money as well as hit our climate goals.</div>

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
Denver’s crime rate has increased at a rate 10X the increase in population from 2021-2022. Using crime statistics from denvergov.org and population stats from macrotrends.net violent crime increased 11.8%, property crime increased 4.6%, other crimes increased 12.3%. Denver’s population only increased 1.22%. Non-violent crime can be just as damaging to our neighborhoods morale as violent crime.
To address the issue we need to 1) Make 311 more efficient such that property crime can and non-violent crime can be reported much more efficiently 2) Increase funding for police 3) Review laws that are unenforceable and either reform them or eliminate them so police can focus on enforcing the laws that will improve the safety.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
To address this issue locally, the answer is not necessarily “more houses”, because the financing of more houses will, a majority of the time, be with a bank that is regional or national in size. The following items improve home affordability. 1) Lower property taxes. 2) Reform the permitting process to remove time and burdensome cost but not at the expense of safety 3) Provide personal finance education that makes consumers aware of the macro-economic environment and the importance of maintaining savings and investments that outpace inflation and interest rates.</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
Not at this time. I would support the will of the voters in that district.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
Denver leaders should promote law enforcement in doing their jobs and penalties should be aligned to the impact of the crime. We all end up downtown for one reason or another. When we do go downtown, we will start to see less negative activity and want to take our families there more.</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
All non-violent crime. We have such a strong emphasis on violent crime and try to rebrand it as "public safety" but it is the non-violent crime that is experienced much more frequently.</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
I am for permissive zoning if the character of the neighborhoods is kept intact.</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
Yes, because they present health safety, and crime concerns.</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
Yes. For side streets, Denver should contract snow plowing to residents willing to be insured and put snow plows on their pickup trucks. You give one resident a section of street and compensate them for plowing if any residents don't report that they haven't through 311.</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
My vision for Denver in 20 years is a diverse city of working professionals and families that have stayed for 20 years because despite rapid growth, faced its challenges head on and was willing to pause and address the core issues like crime and water quality. We went from being the crime capital of America, to the safest city of America.</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
We need to accelerate our lead pipe replacement programs and make their status much more transparent to residents who are still drinking water from lead pipes. Air quality will be improved when people don't have to drive out to the suburbs back to their homes because they feel safe living in the city and their children can get a quality education. After reviewing Debra Johnson's RTD strategic plan and being transparent about the issues and opportunities, Debra gives me hope we can have that for the city of Denver as well.</div>

</aside>
<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong></div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
We must closely monitor the effects of the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance to determine if its incentives and consequences need to be adjusted in order to fulfill its purpose. We must also work to clear the backlog of permit applications; this may require more manpower in the permitting department. We should look at how adaptive reuse can be made more affordable and practical, this could include creating finance stack models with assistance available from the city as well as creating or adopting code specifically aimed a wide variety of adaptive reuse scenarios.</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
I believe that a golf course is the least best use of the open space in Park Hill. If we can use that land to create affordable housing, address a food desert, and create connections to public transit, then I believe we should. However, any development of the former golf course should include a large open space, accessible by the community and the city.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
Healthy cities have strong cores. This requires continued attention to infrastructure, transit options, the business environment, and beautification efforts. But healthy city cores also require people. I believe we must be looking at ways to encourage adaptive reuse of underutilized buildings to encourage more residential use of your downtown. This should include creating models of finance stacks, the adoption of codes that make reuse more viable, and the consideration of implementing tax increment finance districts. But this also includes public safety People must feel secure when they come to downtown, be it to work, shop, play, or live.</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
Our greatest safety concern right now are crime rates like nothing we've seen since the 1980s and 90s. Public safety is a foundational city duty, and if we do not address this problem now, we will be on shaky ground for years, if not decades, to come.</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
When we look to add denser housing in Denver, we should first look at those areas that are set up or have the potential to handle high-density apartments and condos. This includes transit-oriented development surrounding bus stations and light rail stops. But it can also include liberalizing regulations around additional dwelling units; this is a way to increase housing stock in residential areas without radically altering the character of the neighborhood they are built in. Essentially, I believe that we should look at density multipliers where they are appropriate, rather than enact an across-the-board solution.</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
The City of Denver needs to more aggressively invest in safe, dignified dwelling units in which unhoused individuals and families can live. Unless we do this, we will continue in an endless and unproductive cycle of sweeping encampments only to see them pop up in another part of the city. The voters of Denver have spoken, twice, quite clearly on this issue. It's far past time that city leadership stepped up to resolve this impasse.</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
It's understandable and necessary that Denver has a plan for prioritizing the order in which streets get plowed. However, I believe that it is always prudent to reexamine policies from time to time, especially weather-emergency related policies in this era of climate change.</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
In 20 years, I'd like to see a city that has firmly established itself as the capital of the Rocky Mountain West. It would be a city that delivers on its foundational duties to its residents and has fulfilled its promise as a cultural and economic magnet for the country and the world. It's a city that provides a variety of options for public transit, affordable housing, education, and self-betterment. It's a city that is representative, respectful, and inclusive. It is a brave and safe community, with the energy and the drive to continue to grow and thrive over the next twenty years to come.</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
Denver has the opportunity to become a shining example of sustainability, not just in the Rock Mountain West, but in the country and the world. I believe public transit has a huge role to play in this. Getting cars off the road not only reduces our carbon emissions, but it also helps reduce health risks such as respiratory ailments. So yes, I believe Denver can and should be taking a more active role in making sure our people can get where they need to go. In addition, we should be looking at environmental sustainability whenever we are adding density or building new structures, as well as implementing incentives and subsidies for retrofitting existing building up to current environmental standards.</div>
