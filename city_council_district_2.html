<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    The most pressing issue in Denver is our housing/homelessness crisis and it is fundamentally connected to all other issues we are facing in Denver. Having access to safe shelter and housing stabilizes communities and allows people to begin addressing adjacent issues.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    There are many things we need to do in order to address our housing crisis. Immediately we should pass tenant protections, legalize accessory dwelling units, implement rent stabilization and create community owned and developed social housing.</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    No. I support authentic community engagement and protecting green space. No one wants to protect a dead golf course. We need to be intentional in considering impact vs intent, though. As a resident of District 2, it’s important to me to learn and understand from those directly impacted by this issue.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    I would start with safe, multi-modal transportation. We have seen an alarming rise in vehicle caused pedestrian deaths and need to ensure our streets are safe for the various ways folks utilize and access them, not just cars.</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    Our greatest public safety concern is poverty. Our neighborhoods and city are safer when people are thriving. People deserve to have their basic necessities met in order to have that opportunity. Access to safe shelter/housing, food security, healthcare and education, safe transit and green space are proven to lower crime rates.</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    We should be sharing the responsibility of absorbing Denver’s expansion. I do not agree with furthering harm and trauma by over developing historically Black and Brown communities and causing displacement. However, there are many areas across Denver that are exclusively single family zoning. If we want to address the housing crisis, rezoning and building multi-family and multi-income homes across the city is a necessary step.</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    The sweeps are inhumane, cruel and should be stopped. They are also ineffective. We need to repeal the camping ban and approach the crisis of our unhoused neighbors through a housing first lens.</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Yes. First, because the current guidelines are outdated. With our changing climate and access to different and creative ways to deal with snow removal, we need to bring together a task force of sorts with stakeholders and community to reassess our processes and develop new practices. Second, we can not allow folks whose access to the world through sidewalks are snow/ice packed, essentially trapping them.</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    When I think of 5, 10 or even 20 years down the road, I think of our kids. I think of the world they will navigate. I envision a community centered city. A city where people can walk or bike through their neighborhoods and parks and don’t have to hop in a car and drive 15 minutes to find a store or a place to breathe clean air. I see a city where we have compassion for people who are sick or struggling and we have resources to help them. I see a city that stopped prioritizing corporations and developers and profits, and started putting people first.</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    We need to accelerate Denver’s 5-year climate plan, including more funding and educational outreach for programs like e-bike rebates and solar/heat pump subsidies and preserve and expand Denver’s green and open spaces, keeping trees and parks protected while enabling smart, climate-conscious, transit-oriented development.</div>

<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    Escalating costs of housing, including prices and rents, fees and taxes, that drive working families out of the city. We just passed a requirement for inclusion of income-restricted units in all new development of 10 or more units, which helps going forward. We must limit new fees and examine existing ones for reductions. While people are rightly critical of all the new construction, the law of supply and demand is rigid and the penalty for ignoring it is steeper costs, pricing our kids out of the city. We must, however, adhere tightly to our adopted plans by incentivizing new housing where the community has said it wants it, and where we've invested the infrastructure to support it.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    I've addressed some of that in the first question. Let me expand: We've seen that over-development in vulnerable neighborhoods has gentrified working households to places farther out. Our 2019 Comprehensive Plan and Blueprint Denver updates present a clear path as to where housing is needed and should be built. There was tons of community input, and we should respect that by not deviating from it.</div>
<div>Another helpful change would be a thorough revamping of the city's plan review and permitting processes. Denver takes significantly longer to permit a project than other cities, and that adds tremendous costs to housing.</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    Yes. Virtually no one wants it to be a privately owned golf course, but that is what the easement specifically requires it to be. Only two other outcomes exist: 1) The ballot measure results in 2/3rd of the land (100 acres) donated to the city plus $20 million from the developer to create a new regional park, while the 55 acres on Colorado Boulevard becomes 25% affordable housing units in walking distance to the RTD train station; or 2) The city pays the developer $20 to $30 million to buy all 155 acres for a park and no housing near the train station.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Why would we pay that much in taxpayer money to bail out the developer when we can get 2/3rds of the land for free and a new park, plus provide hundreds of affordable housing units steps away from rail transit?</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    With the generational shift in how and where people work, we have an unprecedented opportunity to repurpose much of our downtown commercial office space into housing. There is wonderful precedent for this: The old Security Life building at 1600 Glenarm Place was built in 1967 as an office skyscraper, with the Top of the Rockies restaurant on the top floor. Twelve years ago it was converted to 333 residential units. With the downtown workforce now about half of pre-COVID, unused space can help turn office buildings into mixed-use spaces.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Along with that comes the need to ensure public safety, transit reliability and services for those living in encampments, to get them into sheltered housing and off the street.</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    The surge in both violent and property crime. As recent Post articles document, crime has spiked during and after the pandemic. Criminals must be held accountable, and also held in jail when appropriate for the crime. Denver Police are significantly understaffed and 911 response times have risen again. We must recruit and train new officers selected for their motivation to serve and protect the public, and fill the vacancies.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We must also invest more in alternative responses to non-violent calls for service, such as through our highly regarded STAR program, which I strongly supported. We must also invest our social services capital to address the determinates of crime in our at-risk neighborhoods.</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    That's a loaded way of asking should we eliminate single family zoning. No, we should not. The zoning code isn't "protection," it's our carefully drawn planning. The speculators, flippers and investors like to argue that single family neighborhoods are "exclusionary" and we need to add multi-family. Bull. My southwest Denver district is one of the city's most affordable. It's working class and more racially and ethnically integrated than the city itself. There's no Denver neighborhood where upzoned "gentle density" has brought affordability, and families gentrified out of them are finding attainable homes in my single-family areas. I say, stick with our adopted plans and absorb population growth where we have thoughtfully planned for it, including in parts of my district.</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    It is a public health and safety necessity to clean up encampments that have grown so overwhelmingly unsanitary that they've become a hazard to health and safety. There may be changes that are warranted -- e.g., intensified outreach to those trying to survive on the streets to get them into services, shelter and housing -- but curtailing the cleanups invites more decline in a city that needs to get back on its feet. There is no compassion, dignity or humanity in ignoring the plight of people who are homeless. My goal is to get people off the streets and into services and housing. Leaving encampments to worsen to the point of human waste, needles and vermin is contrary to all that is decent in us as Americans.</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    No, the policy is a good one even if every once in a while, we have a wet early-winter snow that freezes to the streets. The last time this happened was 2006, sixteen years ago. What should change, within the existing policy, is to assign additional crews to our motor graders and blades to be able to remove the ice from more places more quickly.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There's no need to spend substantially more taxpayer money sending small plows to every street when there's three inches of snow. The current policy of sending them for five or more inches is sufficient.</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    Denver in 20 years will be a city that has a diverse network of distinct neighborhoods that offer opportunity to every resident, whether born and raised here or moved here yesterday. It has a vibrant downtown, great walkable urban neighborhoods, formal as well as natural parks and trails, quiet suburban areas, employment centers, creative and artistic zones, and more. We don't make all parts of town look alike, but respect that we offer a diversity of environments that will attract people with differing needs, tastes and desires.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We do this by honoring the hard work that went into our Comp Plan 2040 and Blueprint Denver updates, and not ignoring them just because there's money that can be made. I will continue to closely monitor and enforce adherence to those plans.</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    Yes to a more active role in transit, through expansion of micro-mobility options and first/last mile connections to the RTD network. As chair of DRCOG this year, I oversaw allocation of $15 million to start design on Federal Boulevard Bus Rapid Transit infrastructure, as well as shepherding the process for setting greenhouse gas reduction targets on metro transportation projects and removing I-25 widening from the long-range plan. Also, Denver needs to work with Denver Water to expand the use of recycled "purple pipe" water for industrial and irrigation purposes, so we can use our limited fresh water resources more than once. Finally, expand our Climate Action office's role in electrification and weatherization of older homes to improve affordability and sustainability.</div>

<div><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
    Lack of affordable housing is the single most urgent issue facing Denver. For decades now, the city has put forth plans and initiatives to address homelessness that have not worked. One data point suggests that the population of houseless folks has reached a 14-year high. To say this is unacceptable is a gross understatement.</div>
<div></div>
<div>A housing first approach works and that's how I would address this issue. Let's make it easier and cheaper to build accessory dwelling units, expand the sanctioned camping program, and aggressively pursue affordable housing development in a way that does not displace existing residents.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let's take care of our people regardless of their situation and acknowledge that the issue is a lack of affordable housing, not a lack of effort by those affected.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
    There are several things we can do to address the city's lack of affordable housing immediately.
    We need to make it easier for folks to build accessory dwelling units by reducing the barriers and costs associated with these projects. Increased density will help our affordable housing crisis.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We also need to pursue affordable housing developments aggressively to reduce the gap between how many units we have and how many we need. Proposition 123, which was passed at the State level, will help and there are a few other policies that are in place which will help, but ultimately we will still fall short.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let's incentivize developers to include more affordable housing units in their developments instead of just the minimum now required by the city.</div>
<div><strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
    Yes, because we need to get moving on building affordable housing units. I understand the reasoning behind opposing the development of this property, but I believe our need for housing, in this case, outweighs other considerations.</div>
<div><strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
    I think it's important to recognize that pre-pandemic levels of downtown activity may not return for several years, if at all. With that in mind, I propose we create a downtown that favors people over cars to revitalize it. The concept was wildly popular with most folks when streets were shut down to allow for restaurants to function during the pandemic. Let's create robust and protected bike lane infrastructure, complete the 5280 Trail, and create a positive experience to draw in visitors and residents alike.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We can also get creative with the use of vacant office space. Where possible, let's convert this excess space into housing to help address our affordable housing crisis. Let's also think creatively about how we could support our small and local business owners.</div>
<div><strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
    For those I've spoken to in District 2, public safety is one of the biggest concerns. I've heard first-hand experiences with property damage, gunfire, theft, etc. In the past month in my neighborhood, I know someone personally who had a catalytic converter stolen and valuable packages taken from their doorstep in two separate instances.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Roughly 27% of the city's budget goes toward our police and sheriff's office and we still have many residents feeling uneasy. There are simple things we can do to make people feel safer including regular patrols around high-incident areas, more automated policing efforts, and more positive/productive responses to residents when interactions with police are necessary. People are upset and disappointed, let's regain that trust through community work.</div>
<div><strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
    Yes, we need all areas of Denver to help resolve the affordable housing crisis. Permissive zoning is an important piece of that puzzle. I don't believe it's unreasonable to prioritize people over property values, especially as we are working to address the current housing crisis.</div>
<div><strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
    No. We need to stop the sweeps immediately and provide more sanctioned housing areas at least until affordable housing supplies can be increased to the point that everyone has a place to call home. These sweeps are cruel, counter-productive, and do nothing to address the root cause of the issue.</div>
<div><strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
    Yes. The current policy is rooted in environmental concerns regarding particles polluting the air from plowing, but the ice build-up this winter is an equity concern. Our residents must, at the very minimum, be able to safely move around and have safe access to bus and light rail stops. I propose we take a look at prioritizing certain public access areas and find a way to prevent the icy mess we've all been living with this past month.</div>
<div><strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
    My vision would be for a Denver with clean air and water, plenty of housing for our ever-growing population, and no abuses of power from our police or politicians. This is a relatively simple vision but I believe it is one that would serve our residents best. We can't continue with business as usual to get there. We need leaders who can imagine an equitable future that serves the needs of our communities first instead of the loudest people in the room where decisions are made.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I would engage the community differently. Public hearings and the more antiquated ways of reaching people are no longer adequate. Many folks cannot go to a public meeting or wouldn't feel welcome for a variety of reasons, so let's meet them where they are at instead of where we are.</div>
<div><strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
    We need to encourage more public transportation and increase the use of renewable energy on our grid as quickly as possible, both of which will increase the quality of our air and water supply. We are facing a climate crisis and we need to act like it. We owe it to the future generations to do everything we can to prevent further degradation of our natural environment.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Yes, the city should take a more active role in transit. From inadequate bus stops, to crime and drug use on the light rail, lack of drivers, lack of service to certain areas, etc. there are several changes that need to be made.</div>
