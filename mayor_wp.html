</aside><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
- Brown cloud/bad air (pollution) in Denver: Free public improved transportation. Commuters leave their cars at home and have a relaxed ride to their jobs. Their parking spaces have to be turned into gardens/parks.
- Slow down traffic on major streets by flower beds, pieces of art.
- Get rid of lawns. Grass is no good for anything except pee and poop for dogs.
- Instead of grass grow original Colorado vegetation or/and productive gardens.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
Empty big buildings and turn into apartments and mother-in-law suites to single family buildings. Employers have to provide housing, at least for the homeless working population.

<strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
No. We need every green space. It does not grow on trees. We can have malls etc. anywhere, but cannot increase the amount of green space, the lungs of the city.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
Slow down traffic, keep cars out of downtown, grow flowerbeds, install open air art objects, play grounds for children, open air movies, open air theater, open air restaurants, bars, special open air markets: real farmers' markets, flea markets, barter markets, antique markets on the streets

<strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
Death at traffic stop: don't do it!

<strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
Absorb. It is never good to separate single family from multiple family buildings. it is not good to separate living spaces from working areas. Look at Europe.

<strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
Never sweep and take away private belongings never, ever, (constitutional rights) from the most vulnerable population. They are just like you and me - after a catastrophic life's experience. They have to get a chance to recover. They are not mentally ill.
The working homeless have to get housing by their employers.

<strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
It does not matter - it is not life threatening like the homeless situation.

<strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
- Breathable, livable, likable, lovable.
- Work hard.
- See previous paragraphs

<strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>

</aside><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
Living on the streets is neither safe nor humane – for people experiencing homelessness or community. I will eliminate unsanctioned encampments in year one. Additionally, I will:

• Take a regional, data-driven approach: Work with regional governments to establish a coordinated strategy and strengthen our data system to ensure it is complete and sophisticated.
• Invest in prevention: Support those at risk of homelessness by ensuring access to job supports and stabilizing services.
• Evolve sheltering and build housing: Evolve our shelters to ensure we have safe beds to serve the diverse unhoused population. Build the housing needed to best support people exiting homelessness.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
We need housing solutions that benefit people across the income spectrum, particularly the “missing middle” who earn too much to qualify for most public assistance but struggle to make ends meet. My plans to ensure more housing – for rent and sale, market-rate and subsidized - include:

• Building more housing on underutilized, publicly owned land and rethinking and revitalizing downtown and surrounding neighborhoods by converting commercial space to residential.
• Increasing density on major transportation corridors and at transit stations and working with neighborhood groups to find appropriate approaches for their communities.
• Fundamentally restructuring how development is reviewed and regulated in Denver.

<strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
State law states that only a judge has the authority to lift a conservation easement. <em>Remainder of candidate's answer was not responsive to the question.</em>

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
Making sure our residents and visitors feel safe is the first step toward revitalizing Downtown and it’ll be among my highest priorities. If employees and visitors don’t feel safe, stores don’t stay open and hotels close. Our entire region depends on a thriving downtown and my plan to end unsanctioned camping within my first year in office has been endorsed by four sitting metro area mayors. We will begin immediately working with property owners to convert some existing downtown office space to residential, and focus on retaining businesses and attracting new jobs and investments to restore the vibrancy of downtown.

<strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
I will take a comprehensive approach to community safety. My safety priorities include:

• Strengthening the Denver Police Department, so we can attract and retain more officers to the force, particularly women and people of color.
• Working with our public safety officials – leaders, officers, and staff – to create a stronger culture built around national best practices, transparency, and accountability.
• Increasing investment in civilian response units to ensure we provide appropriate resources (e.g. - mental health support) and free up officers to focus on true crime.
• Address crime prevention by investing in housing, health care, education, and economic development.

<strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
From a planning and zoning perspective, a “one size-fits-all” approach doesn’t work. If we are going to bring down the cost of housing, we need to promote smart density. Smart density has benefits: it reduces cost of living, improves water efficiency and air quality, promotes efficient transportation, creates economic opportunity, furthers social integration. And, there are many ways to achieve smart density – ADUs, duplexes, townhouses, condos. I will work with City Council and neighborhood groups to promote smart density in ways that make sense for each neighborhood so those who work in Denver can afford to make their home here.

<strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
No. It is a tremendous waste of resources to move people down the block or around the corner. We need real solutions to ending homeless encampments. I will expand and evolve our shelter capacity and build more housing. While doing that, I’ll temporarily expand the use of sanctioned, supported camping. We must provide more humane and safer alternatives. If people refuse services and supports, I will use the legal authority to intervene to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the individual and the broader community. Unsheltered living in public spaces is not an acceptable option.

<strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
No. The current city policy is to clear side streets when the forecast calls for 6” or more of snow accumulation. That is reasonable and possible to implement. Unfortunately, earlier this winter, the city’s decision not to clear side streets was made based on an inaccurate forecast and then the temperatures remained below freezing for much of January, preventing melt-off. It was a frustrating situation – and for many people a costly one too – but plowing side streets every time it snows would not be financially responsible not to mention the challenge of having enough drivers.

<strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
I see a city of promise: a place where all people have access to shelter and housing. Where we all feel safe and take pride in our neighborhoods. Where parents can age in the houses they raised their kids – and those kids can afford to buy homes and plant roots, too. A city with a world class education system and a set of strong civic and arts institutions that nurture community. A region working together to address transportation and climate change. I’ll work collaboratively – across sectors and with regional partners – with urgency and purpose to restore the promise of Denver.

<strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
I’ll make Denver a national and global leader on climate by capitalizing on recent federal funding and promoting policies that ensure communities most impacted by air and water pollution benefit from new investment. Priorities will include:

• Promoting housing density, particularly along transportation corridors and at transit sites, and supporting the conversion of vacant office space to housing.
• Supporting the education and training necessary to prepare Denver residents, particularly people of color, for green economy sector jobs.
• Fostering partnerships with RTD, DPS and DRCOG to reduce emissions from our publicly-owned fleets and promoting regional action on air quality and water conservation.

</aside><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
Our housing crisis is our number one issue in Denver and will need immediate and multifaceted solutions. We must repurpose land use and preserve our green space, which we cannot afford to lose. Building attainable and affordable housing to meet the needs of individuals and families today, and over the next few years, will require a fundamental restructuring of the city’s housing portfolio. Only about 1% of Denver’s housing units are dedicated to public housing. All of this must be done while focusing on sustainability, ensuring safe multimodal transportation, and combating gentrification.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
Along with what is above I would:

- Repurpose brown and grey space to introduce dense, affordable, and social housing
- Strengthen tenants’ rights through just eviction law and providing an option for tenants to buy their buildings
- Support preferential zoning to community land trusts which prioritize the needs of residents while generating wealth
- Include community members in new development planning by implementing participant-public-private partnerships
- Create inclusionary zoning that requires new development to offer housing to low- and moderate-income families at or below 50% average monthly income.
- Eliminate the red tape around permits that slows homeowners and builders from completing projects

<strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
I do not support the plan put forward by Westside Development. Currently, Denver has less than 3/4 of the recommended park space per capita. Our housing plan shouldn’t be driven by corporate developers making backroom deals with compromised politicians. We should proactively pursue opportunities to expand city parkland and parkways. Development without strategic consideration threatens our parks and health.

As mayor, I commit to building deeply affordable and mixed-income social housing in grey and brown spaces to reach our housing, affordability, and climate goals. A public realm needs to be nurtured district-by-district, with city leadership, not just private enterprise.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
We have a beautiful downtown that has earned a horrible reputation due to 12+ years of failed policies. As Mayor I will:

- Implement housing-first and harm-reduction policies
- Increase investment in wrap-around services to address chronic homelessness and addiction crisis
- Implement a safer and more connected multimodal transportation system to meet Denver’s needs
- Bring together our small businesses and art leaders to determine how to grow our downtown
- Create reliable funding streams for at-risk legacy businesses with historical and cultural ties to the community
- Promote business growth along with our arts to achieve both modernization and cultural celebration

<strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
Our number one public safety concern is gun violence. Gun violence, like the multiple crises we face in Denver, shares a similar root: economic and racial inequality. Having faced poverty, hunger, inadequate health care options for a child with a chronic condition, and even threats of foreclosure from a predatory lender, I know the fear and anxiety felt when facing security crises. We must address inequalities at the root rather than pursuing Band-Aid solutions. I would protect our city by strengthening our safety social nets for tenants, workers, and marginalized communities. Furthermore, I will increase the city's transparency and accountability.

<strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
In order to combat our climate crisis we must combat urban sprawl, this means moving away from single-family home development. Changing zoning to allow more mixed-use, multifamily development and mixed-income buildings in commercial zones, city-owned land, and under-enrolled repurposed school buildings will provide a diversity of housing options for first-time homebuyers and boost the small business economy. This return to the village concept has the added benefit of encouraging social engagement with neighbors and local small business owners so that everyone is invested and feels a part of the vibrancy of their neighborhoods.

<strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
Our homeless crisis is solvable when we invest in solutions that approach the root cause. I will end the costly, ineffective sweeps and replace them with 24/7 crisis intervention responders. As mayor, I will:

- Support data-proven solutions of a housing-first approach to providing services to our unhoused neighbors, shifting away from a shelter-first approach
- Prioritize the creation of social housing at deeply affordable rates at or below 30% of the average monthly income
- Address barriers to housing beyond affordability, including credit checks, background checks, income multiplier requirements, and lack of ADA-compliant units
- Address core issues that contribute to homelessness, including access to education, workforce training, transportation, and others

<strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
Denver absolutely needs to reimagine how we are approaching our snow plowing. Our current policies are preventing those who are mobility limited from being able to leave their homes. As we are experiencing the impacts of climate change with more extreme weather, we must re-evaluate how this is approached. I will bring together our disability community, seniors, environmental experts, and community planners to create an equitable plowing policy that meets our changing needs.

<strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
My vision of Denver in 20 years includes a city rich in the arts, culture, and community. Every resident has access to quality air, parks, and homes. We are thriving in our communities with local businesses and safe paths to walk, bike, and roll around the city. I see an increased canopy of trees throughout the city that helps clean our air and keep our ground cooler. This isn’t a fantasy and as mayor, I can get us there by investing in root cause solutions that center the most vulnerable in our city. Let’s Reimagine Denver together.

<strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
Denver can join leaders from across the world who have been actively working to establish best-in-class practices to address building and maintaining green cities.

As mayor I will:

- Work with experts to justly transition away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy sources like solar and wind and invest in good-paying jobs in clean, renewable energy
- Give the auditor's office the power to hold us accountable
- Develop a comprehensive program to protect us from dangerous air pollutants that disproportionately affect marginalized communities and exceed both state and federal standards
- Hold polluters like Suncor accountable for the long-term harm they cause

</aside><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
The single most urgent issue is housing stability and affordability. Denver will need city, state and the private sector to bring about a short-term resolution that provides relief and long-term planning to balance growth with affordability.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
What leadership needs to do first is have consensus that there is a lack of affordable housing and that the situation deserves attention and action. The city must work with the legislature, governor's office, public and private sector on creating long-term funding pipelines and affordable housing development targets.

<strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
I do support responsible and equitable redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course. The issue always becomes who will benefit from the redevelopment. If the golf course redevelopment moves in the same direction as most recent redevelopment has, then more working families will not benefit. The community and city should be very involved with creating the guard rails that will prevent exclusionary redevelopment.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
Denver's downtown is mostly a one stop space in which people mainly come to work and then head to other parts of the city for dining, experiences, etc. What we need to do is focus on the repurposing of some space that was gained as a result of offices being more sparsely occupied by working with small and startup businesses that can utilize the space as business incubators or shared space. We need to also focus on making downtown more pedestrian and family-friendly, attracting businesses that make downtown a more attractive space for conventions.

<strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
The greatest public safety concern is selling of fentanyl that is leading to proliferation of crime that often associates itself with drug trafficking. Fentanyl trafficking has increased the number of overdoses in Denver and it is important to target the sources of this issue to significantly impact this trend.

<strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>

<strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
I don't believe that the sweeps should continue in their current form because it is not accomplishing its intended goal. We are not achieving the intended goals and we are simply re-shuffling the unhoused with this method. Removing or shifting the issue out of sight every couple weeks is not solving the issue. What we need is a new strategy that is based on the housing first, case management, and enforcement elements that help identify where we need to meet each impacted individual.

<strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
I think that Denver needs to update its snow plowing strategy and inform the process with updated weather trends. It is important to re-visit this policy because we are becoming a more densely populated city and are making strides at becoming a more pedestrian and bicycle friendly place to navigate. Snow plowing strategy will need to be visited if we want to continue to move in the right direction and keep up with snowfall trending.

<strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
My vision for Denver in 20 years is to reverse the trend that we are currently on that is making our city unaffordable. I believe that we can lead the way in how to grow with equity as a guiding principle ensuring that everyone will have the ability to live, work, and enjoy what this city has to offer. I imagine a place that leads in environmental efforts and that invests in innovative ways to recycle and manage our natural resources. Lastly, I envision a place where neighborhoods feel as if they are connected to the mayor and city council and greater partners in charting the course for Denver.

<strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
As mayor, I will continue to invest in and expand the efforts of the Climate Action, Sustainability, and Resiliency Office. I would utilize the climate protection fund to also focus on water conservation efforts and double down on infrastructure projects that update our water treatment and retention efforts so that we practice conservation from start to finish. The city should take a more active role in transit by working with RTD to find ways to make transit more practical and focus on areas that need a reduction in single-vehicle traffic.

</div>
</aside><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
As mayor, my top priority will be public safety. Denverites and visitors deserve to feel safe in our neighborhoods, parks, and streets and I will commit to rebuilding and improving our Public Safety Department. We will invest in training, hiring, and retaining officers, as well as funding the STAR program so that co-responders can address issues related to mental health and substance use, which will allow our police to perform their core functions: preventing, responding to, and solving crimes. A safer Denver is possible with targeted gun crime prevention, increased patrol of hot-spots, and robust accountability.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
In short, we must quickly build more housing along transit corridors. Every Denverite’s day-to-day experience is inextricably dependent on how they get from where they live to where they’re going. Denver housing has been shaped by siloed zoning, delayed permitting and developed without taking advantage of the benefits of close coordination with transit development. As a result, we have dispersed development and insufficient transit options. We need systemic solutions to realize the benefits of combined housing and multimodal transit: an interconnected and easily traversable city with tens of thousands of additional housing units.

<strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
Yes, I support redeveloping the golf course property. Due to its size, developing the Park Hill Golf Course is an enormous opportunity to provide many overlapping benefits for the community by creating a dynamic park for residents and neighbors to enjoy, and amenities like a badly needed grocery store. The plan includes building a mix of affordable housing near transit and the creation of a significant new city park, all of which will serve the people of Denver better than an out-of-use golf course. I support the Community Benefits Agreements and look forward to ensuring those promises are kept.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
With enhancing public safety as my top priority, I know we can revitalize downtown. We will focus on growing the downtown economy, using placemaking strategies that make downtown more inviting, expanding housing opportunities, and capitalizing on downtown's cultural, civic, and entertainment assets to further support the vibrant environment needed for a thriving city center. We know that increasing population density downtown brings safety benefits because the presence of people deters criminals, so I am excited to see the impact of the Elitch Gardens redevelopment, among other projects that are currently underway. Denver has made great investments from Union Station to RiNo, and now we need to focus on connecting them thoughtfully.

<strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
For me, public safety and public health are closely linked. Both the city’s Parks Department and Public Health Department contributed to the decision to close Civic Center Park in 2021 because of extreme public health risks that the encampments posed to their residents and to the broader public. I supported that decision. Folks living in encampments are in inherently dangerous situations and I want to help the unhoused quickly and efficiently access services they need.

<strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
I support using accessory dwellings and creative solutions to add density in our neighborhoods. Building denser communities leads to benefits like reducing emissions, easing the housing shortage, reducing segregation, and reducing homelessness. Having options for folks to live in our city–across income levels–makes neighborhoods more equitable, more diverse, and ultimately more dynamic. Housing affordability is a matter of supply and demand, and creating more housing stock is one of the best ways to decrease the upward pressure on prices. Recent home prices in Denver have had an exclusionary impact and folks should be able to live near their work.

<strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
The status quo is not working. It is clear that Denver needs a new leader to make real progress on addressing homelessness and ensuring our streets, sidewalks and public areas are open for all Denverites to utilize. As mayor, I will reevaluate Denver’s failing approach to homelessness, reimagine systems to disrupt the cycles perpetuating the problem, and reinforce the existing laws and regulations to ensure that everyone in Denver, housed or unhoused, stays safe. A key part of my homelessness plan is to audit existing programs because we are spending enormous amounts of money without getting results we all deserve.

<strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
We badly need to update our plowing policy by using the latest climate data to craft a new approach. Ensuring infrastructure is safe and usable is the city's job. We're leaving too many of our neighbors behind when we ignore it. If people using wheelchairs, kids going to school, or parents pushing strollers cannot get around for weeks because of thick sheets of snow and ice, we need to fix it. Cities with comparable budgets are doing better than Denver. As mayor, I will work with DOTI to reimagine and redesign our approach beyond the current failing “solar plowing” policy.

<strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
I envision Denver as a connected, thriving, dynamic city, with strong neighborhoods, a vibrant downtown and a world-class airport. We can dramatically improve air quality and reduce emissions if we focus on adding population density in areas with high-quality public transit that is electrified. We must enable residents to meet all of their needs by using a combination of highly efficient public transit, connected bike lanes, EV charging infrastructure, and making our streets safer for pedestrians. My systems engineering background combined with my extensive legislative experience will enable me to deliver this vision of a connected, green, dynamic city.

<strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
With my public and private sector experience, I’m the only candidate who can deliver Denver’s greener, cleaner future. My energy and climate legislation have made Colorado a national climate policy leader. I’ll do the same at the local level as Denver’s next mayor. I plan to add EV chargers, renegotiate with Xcel to protect customers, electrify our transit and heating and cooling systems. I’ll collaborate with Denver Water to promote water efficiency programs and reduce water waste. Through the lens of environmental justice, I’ll address disproportionate pollution in low-income areas. The city must lead the plan to develop transit options.

</aside><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
Denver can do better by addressing the root causes of many of our current struggles. From homelessness to housing affordability and public safety, we have been trying - and failing - to apply “quick fixes” to highly complicated problems that are, in fact, interconnected. As mayor, I’ll put people over politics and focus on solving many of these root causes including education disparities, financial inequalities, housing affordability, and healthcare accessibility. I’ve successfully bolstered Denver’s mental health services through Caring for Denver and improved criminal justice by launching alternative policing programs. I’ll bring that record of accomplishment to the mayor’s office.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
Safe, healthy, accessible, affordable housing is a human right, yet a home has become a luxury many in Denver cannot afford. We need diverse housing options to reduce costs while ensuring people can afford to live in the neighborhood they grew up in. Last year, I led the creation of the Colorado Middle Income Housing Authority that will deliver thousands of attainable housing units for families. As mayor, I will fight for resources to create truly affordable housing and end chronic homelessness; zoning reforms to prioritize fair housing; protections to stabilize tenants; and ways to expand permanent affordability.

<strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
<em>Candidate's answer was not responsive to the question.</em>

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
A city is only as strong as its downtown. Returning the center city to its full vibrancy is one of my top priorities. In the first 100 days, we will host a Downtown Summit with downtown advocates, residents, and business owners. We must increase public safety, get our unhoused neighbors into safe spaces, and make housing more affordable. The 16th Street Mall has to be reimagined again to reflect a post-COVID life. We will incentivize local restaurants and shops in other parts of town to open second locations, and work to attract back the businesses and employees who have left.

<strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
Every person in Denver deserves to feel safe. My record working with law enforcement and the community on innovative solutions to reduce crime is unmatched. I funded the Support Team Assisted Response (STAR) program which has improved policing and mental health support. I created the first bipartisan law enforcement integrity bill with law enforcement support. This same innovation is found in my Community Safety plan that outlines solutions for enforcement, curbing youth violence, getting guns off our streets, reducing hate crimes, alternatives to jail, and addressing theft and vandalism. Together, we can make Denver the safest city in the nation.

<strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
Smart density is key to Denver’s future growth and to quality planning for the future. Denver has a 50,000 unit housing gap. In order to provide these additional units, I believe Denver must leverage vacant and underutilized land and buildings it already owns and partner with communities on projects that will help provide additional housing opportunities at all levels–ensuring that we revitalize and renew our neighborhoods while preserving their unique character and not pricing residents out. We must also eliminate the development permit backlog in order to keep up with the pressing housing demand.

<strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
It’s time to rethink how we address living space for our unhoused neighbors--the current situation is not working for them or for the city. Helping people get back on their feet requires stable housing, but the first step is getting people inside to safe places--ones where they feel comfortable and secure. We’ll expand street outreach, substance use disorder treatment, and harm reduction to ensure that people facing a crisis are aware of new solutions. I will create the progressive change this city needs, and make Denver into a city that works for everyone.

<strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
When it comes to snow removal, Denver can do better. Pedestrians, especially people with disabilities, seniors, and those without other means of transportation, rely on clear walkways and crosswalks. As mayor, I will bring together neighborhood leaders and community advocates to map out exactly where our city resources should be focused, while ensuring we aren’t hurting our environment and making sure that our snow removal workers are supported and have the appropriate equipment they need to succeed.

<strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
I love this city and I know we can do better. Denver can be a safe, affordable city that works for everyone. I envision a Denver where: we have thriving arts and culture; people that need mental health or substance use disorder care can get it before it becomes a crisis; and we put people first in every decision the city makes. Denver is going through a period of change and I have a track record of accomplishment putting results over politics and moving us forward on important issues. It will take grit and determination, but we will make Denver better.

<strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
Climate change and air and water quality issues are deeply linked. We’ve all experienced the dreaded brown cloud. Pollution is causing ill health effects, especially in our most vulnerable communities. I have a strong record of supporting renewable energy incentives and protecting water sources. To truly be a Green City, we must focus on improving air and water quality, increasing transit options, and reducing carbon emissions through renewables and energy efficiency, all while ensuring that communities of color are not disproportionately impacted by these changes. Denver is ready to protect its future.

</aside><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
One of the biggest risks Denver faces is the risk of a doom loop that other cities have entered where increased homelessness and crime drive businesses and individuals out of downtown. Decreased visits downtown shutter restaurants and bars, reducing commercial occupancy which in turn reduces tax revenue, decreases our tax base, and decreases the public services. This can lead to a decrease in safety and disincentivizes residents to revitalize a city that is struggling. However, the first hurdle that Denver faces is the belief that these problems can’t be solved. We not only know these problems can be solved, but we should expect that they will be solved, and as the next mayor I will solve them.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
I spent the last two years building a coalition of 260 organizations to support passage of Proposition 123, which will provide Denver with $50 million a year to solve this problem. Here is how I will do it:

1) build 25,000 permanently affordable units where no Denverite will pay more than 30% of their income to rent and rent can’t go up unless your income goes up;
2) eliminate the red tape that slows housing development by requiring that affordable housing permits get approved within 90 days;
3) help renters build wealth and buy homes by directing up to $100 a month of their rent check into a savings account;
4) expand the Dearfield Down Payment Assistance Program.

<strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
Yes. I had an office in North Park Hill for 10 years, and saw the two most urgent issues in Park Hill are the gentrification driving out Black residents through the disappearance of affordable housing, and the fact that the neighborhood is currently a food desert that needs better access to groceries. Park Hill deserves open space, affordable housing, and a grocery store, and this project can provide all three. This project allows us the chance to create a public park larger than Central Park with more than 500 units of affordable housing, outdoor and indoor recreation space, local businesses, and transit adjacent housing. Voting no provides neither housing nor open space, it only returns use to a golf course, which everyone agrees we don’t need.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
As the CEO of a business located at Union Station, I have seen this problem firsthand over the last three years. Denver needs to revitalize downtown by solving our crises of homelessness and crime. In addition, the next mayor needs to lead the charge to encourage businesses to return to working in-person by first doing the same with city workers and then encouraging other businesses to follow suit. We can do this by encouraging workers to come downtown through incentives for downtown childcare facilities and discounted and free public transit.

<strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
Denver’s greatest public safety concern is the city-wide increase in crime and the feeling that downtown is inhospitable. Solving this issue requires four concrete steps:

1) focusing on prevention through early intervention with diversionary courts like mental health, drug, and gun courts;
2) putting 200 additional first responders on the streets, including mental health workers to support those in crisis and beat cops walking the streets;
3) converting two pods of the jail into mental health and addiction units that can provide services people badly need;
4) after providing permanent supportive housing for those who are homeless, enforcing the law on those who are committing crimes or harassing residents downtown.

<strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
We know we need to add more housing supply to make Denver affordable. To meaningfully achieve housing abundance in Denver, we must add density in select areas of the city. This should be prioritized around transit oriented development and other places where we can prioritize density and reduce parking requirements. We also know we want to preserve the unique identity of each of our neighborhoods by not erecting skyscrapers in the middle of residential neighborhoods. However, in many neighborhoods, it is effective and consistent with the architecture and planning to add gentle density in the midst of single family neighborhoods.

<strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
We know the current policy of sweeping is not working because people who are experiencing homelessness have no place to go. I would solve this problem by building 10-20 micro-communities that would include permanent supportive housing for 1,400 individuals. Then we can move communities of encampments together to safe, satable, dignified housing where they can get the addiction, mental health, and workforce services they need. Once we meet that obligation to make sure everyone has a place to sleep, we must also ensure all Denver residents can enjoy our public spaces, businesses, and sidewalks. Once dignified housing is available people should not need or have the right to sleep outside someone's home or business.

<strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
As climate change leads to harsher winters and snow storms like the ones we’ve experienced this winter become more frequent, effectively plowing roads and side streets will become more necessary. But this is a fixable problem and we cannot tolerate another winter like this one. As mayor, I will ensure that we expand our snow plowing reach and frequency, particularly on side streets, to make sure streets are clean and we are not plowing snow into bike lanes and sidewalks that increase hazards for Denverites.

<strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
I believe that one of the biggest obstacles Denver faces is believing our current problems are unfixable. I deeply believe that we can make Denver America’s best city. In 20 years, my vision for Denver is to be the best city to raise a child, start a business, train for a job, and experience diverse art, culture, and food. Denver can also be the first big city in America where no one sleeps on the street at night, where teachers and nurses can still afford to live in the city they serve, and where you can eat on a patio while your kids run around the 16th Street Mall without worrying for their safety.

<strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
Denver’s most pressing environmental issue is the city’s reliance on nonrenewable energy. I am committed to transforming the city into a national leader in clean energy and climate sustainability by committing to have 100 percent of Denver’s electricity sourced from renewable sources by 2040. This requires electrifying our fleet and electrifying our buildings while reducing vehicle emissions by providing incentives to increase the use of public transit, increase ridership, and increase route frequency and ride quality. We must also take a more aggressive approach to preserving water by incentivizing turf and xeriscaping wherever possible.

</aside><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
Housing and gentrification
Housing and gentrification work hand-in-hand. People move into a neighborhood paying higher than normal prices and begin to change the standards of a neighborhood. These drastic and quick moving changes make it difficult for existing residents to meet the higher costs of living in the neighborhood and are forced to leave. Our administration will put together bona fide programs such as down payment assistance that will not work against the applicant and their debt-to-income ratio. This can be done by providing down payment assistance loans that will not become due until the mortgage loan is paid for or the home is sold.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
Our administration will put together bona fide programs such as down payment assistance that will not work against the applicant and their debt-to-income ratio. This can be done by providing down payment assistance loans that will not become due until the mortgage loan is paid for or the home is sold. Our administration will also put together educational courses on how to raise their FICO scores, making qualifying for a home loan a strong possibility.

<strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
Not at this time. This is a prime example of the current administration ignoring the objections of Park Hill residents.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
It begins with beautification, along with small business incentives.

<strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
More police on force. Better recruitment and better training.

<strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
Denver neighborhoods need to be in control as to what happens in their communities. Our administration will enforce and adhere to Neighborhood Registered Organizations (NRO) neighborhood plans. Any Planned Unit Developments (PUD) application and land-use change request that will affect a Denver neighborhood will have to comply with residents and the neighborhood plan as stipulated in Blueprint Denver before being considered. I firmly believe your neighborhood and home should be your safe haven! Developments, corporations and organizations that negatively impact Denver neighborhoods will not be allowed.

<strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
We have to stop hasty remedies and work on solutions! If we analyze the problems that lead to homelessness, then we’ll find solutions. We need to focus on restructuring current programs and facilities or bring in new ‘state of the art’ programs and facilities to include career education for better paying jobs and doctors and Psychiatrists specializing in mental health issues and drug addiction. Our administration will focus on assisted living for people and families experiencing homelessness.

<strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
Yes.

<strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
Our goal is to have Denver become the icon city of the United States. Beautification, attractions, events and make Denver more inviting.

<strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
Strict enforcement of pullution violations. Denver must take the lead in protecting Denver's enviroment. Through traffic has to be encouraged to use the 470 highway system. This will help the idiling of slow moving traffic on I-25 and I-70.

</aside><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
There is no one-size-fits-all solution to homelessness, but we need more treatment beds for unhoused people in crisis. First, I will declare homelessness a public emergency to mobilize existing and future resources from local, state and federal organizations. Second, we must expand single room occupancy housing (SRO’s) and remove any zoning barriers. Last, I will prioritize regional partnerships for housing, treatment and wraparound services – including the critical missing piece of job connection and helping people to self-sufficiency – resulting in less demand on our already strained resources and long-term solutions to the crisis.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
The EHA program created by City Council begins to address this by expediting permits for affordable units, but more work is required to fix Denver’s broken permitting process so that affordable housing can be brought online more efficiently. Additionally, we need to invest more strategically in alternative housing, including modular homes, repurposing vacant units and/or commercial buildings, and ADUs. We should also identify vacant public lands for manufactured housing at 40% cheaper than on-site new construction. Last, the housing demand of our senior population is growing and we need to look ahead to prevent them from falling into homelessness.

<strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
As the only elected candidate in this race who had to take a formal position on the Park Hill Golf Course, I supported moving it forward to the voters, so they have a voice in this important decision. Development of this private property will address many of our city’s greatest needs by creating 100 acres of parks and open space and hundreds of new affordable housing units, including for-sale units; giving more Denverites the opportunity for home ownership. These community benefits will be recorded as restrictive covenants on the land, if approved by the voters.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
We need our downtown to be the economic engine that it once was, with thriving businesses, and a robust presence of residents, workers and conventioneers. As mayor, I will partner with government agencies, businesses, and nonprofits to restore and activate downtown storefronts and host world class events. Additionally, we need to look at congestion and give people alternatives to single occupancy vehicles by providing a mass transportation connection from downtown to River Mile, Auraria Campus, and Empower Field. This assumes we’ve solved the issues of homelessness and safety, as outlined in my previous answers.

<strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
I intend to strengthen Denver’s public safety by standing up a Metro Task Force to crack down on auto theft, bicycle theft, and keeping deadly drugs out of our city. To do that, we need better recruitment, training and retention of our public safety personnel.

Our law enforcement officers must also reflect the diversity of our city. One way we can achieve this is by encouraging Denver’s young people into the Public Safety Cadet Program. Additionally, I will expand our gun buy-back program to get dangerous weapons off our streets.

<strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
The City got it right with changes to Blueprint Denver. The 2010 Zoning expands housing opportunities along the edges of our neighborhoods including commercial corridors, while allowing accessory dwelling unit's across the city. With that said, we need tools to protect our remaining affordable neighborhoods from gentrification. I served on the committee that made changes to our Group Living Ordinance that allows more unrelated people to live in larger homes. I have been – and will continue to be – a proponent for increasing housing options across the spectrum of price points.

<strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
It is inhumane to let people suffer and die on our streets. With 15 shelters in our city, Denver is not lacking for temporary housing.

It is critical that we address the public health hazard of encampments, but this is only the first step in solving homelessness. The process, which requires advanced notice, must connect our diverse unhoused population to local and regional resources, including mental health services, treatment beds, training, a pathway to employment, which supports the rebuilding of self-worth and purpose.

<strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
Denver’s snow plowing policy currently uses sand and de-icing agents that are harmful to the environment. As mayor, I will explore other options that reduce our dependence on harmful agents and allocate more of our snow plow vehicles to clear snow and ice on our residential streets and bike lanes.

<strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
Under my leadership, Denver will become an affordable, safe, and prosperous city, with a thriving downtown and a transportation system that closes gaps in connectivity, while addressing safety and cost. Housing will be attainable across all price points and income will not be a barrier to calling Denver home. Denver will grow as a hub of economic innovation, offering inspiring careers for both new and longtime residents. We will restore public safety and refine essential government services. With unparalleled experience and knowledge of the city, I have a plan to achieve this vision. You can read about it at debbieortega.com.

<strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
Environmental causes have defined my career, from forcing the cleanup of contaminated sites, to protecting parkland, to prioritizing alternative transportation technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In our growing city, this multifaceted issue requires a proactive, holistic approach. My Infrastructure Master Plan will inform and guide future development, reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and protect taxpayers from unnecessary cost and disruption.

</aside><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
Housing availability and pricing is Denver's biggest issue. Other issues like violence and small business retention stem from our housing issues and cost. Rental and purchase prices are too high. Instead of continuing to focus on 'affordable housing,' it's time to focus now on more public/social housing and rent controls. Denver needs to also bring a public banking system to pay to for the new build or retrofitted housing. Safe encampments and services are needed for those who are chronically homeless.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
More public/social housing is now needed in Denver; our city is only continuing to grow. 'Affordable housing' is owned by developers, and it's only a percentage of what they build. There are nearly 20,000 "affordable housing' units available in the metro area. Public housing is owned and maintained by the city and its tax-paying constituents. A public banking system needs to be implemented in Denver

<strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
No I do not support the development. Why would Westside Investment purchase an open space with an easement already attached? $2,000,000 was paid by citizens for it to become a conservation easement. Green space is limited, and as I stated, there is not a need for that type of 'affordable housing' in the area. It will totally gentrify the remainder of NE Park Hill. I do not support a citywide ballot measure vote for developers to decide on development to make money.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
Denver needs to become a 24-hour city and have more of a focus on small business retention and safety for the area. The 16th Street Mall should be an arts district, with thousands of people safely walking through the area, all night even if they feel the want or need. More services for unhoused neighbors and safe encampments that lead the unhoused population to areas safer for them outside of downtown can make it safer for them and everyone else as well. People without proper resources congregate downtown looking for warmth and resources.

<strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
Youth violence and domestic violence make up the bulk of our homicides. Last year, there were 88, in 2021 there were 96, and there were 95 in 2022. We need more youth centers and arts-related services to engage that population. We need more mental health and family services to be prioritized here in Denver.

<strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
I support permissive zoning. Density and diversity is needed to address our housing crisis and for better environmental justice. High housing prices, HOA fees, RNO's, and security regimens are in place in many single-family neighborhoods. I do not think any additional protections at this time needed to be added.

<strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
No they should not. Not having money is not a crime. With more availability for housing by growing our public housing stock and implementing rent controls, and adding city-sponsored safe encampment spaces with showers, trash receptacles, outdoor restroom facilities, mental health services, safe lighting, etc., will really elevate the need for our unhoused neighbors to encamp in various spaces that they feel are a safe haven if these services are not available.

<strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
Denver needs to have a fully staffed, and well managed fleet of snow plowing vehicles. There should be a special attention paid to our side streets, school areas, and senior living communities like Windsor Gardens or Kappa Towers. Our side streets are where we really live in this city concerning walking, parking, driving to and from home, etc. Main roads and side streets need to be plowed as soon as the snow begins to fall, like how CDOT stays ahead of the inches that could pile up on our highways. Small businesses should be contracted with, or incentivized to maintain walking and biking areas the city can not reach.

<strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
Denver needs to be a world class, 24-hour, diverse, fully serviced city in 20 years. Denver is in danger of being a tale of two cities in one, either you're in a high-rise barely staying afloat, or you're sleeping in the mean streets. Adding housing availability, and true affordability at all levels of income, focusing our small business and large business retention will make sure Denver is ready in the near future and in 20 years. Adding a public banking system to generate additional infrastructure income and banking services, and bringing the arts, trade market, and entertainment industries here to make sure Denver is a leader in the arts industries that will bring jobs, tax and tourist revenue, and positive energy and comradery to Denver.

<strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
Environmental justice starts with housing justice and getting vehicles off of our streets. Air quality, water quality, and ground contamination are being affected by people needing to use gasoline and propane tanks for warmth. There are no trash receptacles and true services for the unhoused in Denver. Recycling from large businesses, and festivals, working to lower emissions from Suncor in Commerce City. Working with RTD for better public transportation schedules for buses and trains, and helping to push the conversation of them using more clean energy vehicles will give us a much better air quality.

</aside><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
While tackling escalating crime and homelessness are top priorities, Denver’s skyrocketing living costs requires urgent action. It is crushing all but the most wealthy households.

Ensuring broad access to opportunity to build incomes while expanding our total and diverse supply of housing will take significant time so it’s urgent to get these plans started. My plans extend to containing costs through greater healthy food access, more safe, efficient, healthful and diverse mobility options.

Boosting opportunity and economic mobility will require a structural relationship between the city and Denver Public Schools and deeper collaboration with higher education and the business community.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
While working in finance and volunteering with local civic groups, I’ve helped expand affordable housing.

There are numerous components of our affordable housing shortage, all supply-related given the overwhelming demand for living here. I’ll focus on strategies to:

- Grow total supply through affordability planning.
- Expand the diversity of supply, particularly in the “missing middle” units that rely on low-medium and medium density, particularly in transit corridors throughout the city.
- Accelerate the development of affordable housing of all types by granting permitting and other administrative advantages.
- Expand coordination throughout the metro area given that housing is a regional market.

<strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
I’m increasingly concerned that the current redevelopment proposal is not the right approach. Both sides are arguing that their approach makes a material difference in ameliorating larger systemic challenges like access to nature or affordability. This is simply not the case and is an extraordinary distraction from reality and fact. I believe the key issues for any redevelopment rely on greater mitigation of the impacts on surrounding neighborhoods, which the proposed Park Hill plan does not do.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
Curbing crime and helping unhoused people get off the streets is foundational to revitalize downtown. We also need to make Denver more affordable and advance broader economic activity.

My economic development team will work with landlords to use vacant ground floor space for pop-up galleries, restaurant innovations, recreation places, and even greenhouses with community access. I also want to start weekday Ciclovias, mass events for walking, biking, rolling and exercise.

We will engage community and industry to create a bold vision to reposition commercial space glut. They can house dwellings, arts, nonprofit, childcare, education and healthcare in combination.

<strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
Our safety ranks are short by about 50% based on the size of our city; these numbers don’t work. We will enhance equity and strengthen trust between law enforcement and the community by expanding our ranks through recruiting in diverse neighborhoods. We will support our officers, improve job satisfaction and retention, implement rigorous non-lethal and de-escalation training to protect life, and expand innovative programs like STAR.

I will coordinate with the Legislature and our neighbors to improve outcomes.

My manager of safety will be an experienced leader, charged with advocacy for department needs and accountability through greater transparency.

<strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
Yes. Increasing both the total and diversity of housing supply, with particular focus on the so-called “missing middle,” will be a priority for my administration and should be supported by neighborhoods as respectful additions. This will mean medium low- and medium-density to boost total and diversity of supply in all neighborhoods. Medium density must be focused in high efficiency transit corridors to pave the way to deliver dramatically more “missing middle” product. Blueprint Denver supports this which I was consistently engaged in as a member of the task force.

<strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
My administration will continue sweeping unauthorized homeless encampments in order to maintain health and safety for all people living in them and in surrounding neighborhoods. Denver has extensively documented the hazardous and unsanitary conditions that exist in encampments. It is also my expectation that unauthorized encampments will diminish significantly as we implement my plan which will create substance use and/or mental health disorder treatment pathways to be accessed voluntarily or involuntarily for those who are of danger to themselves or others, and other emerging programs.

<strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
My administration will improve our snow plowing with more up-to-the-minute, detailed communication with the people of Denver, specific to their location. Denverites will know where snow removal operations will occur for each storm. People will be able to plan their commutes and other trips better, especially those with mobility challenges and who don’t have the option to work from home.

What can Denverites do to ensure accessibility ramps and sidewalks are cleared at intersections? We can coordinate volunteers, like neighborhood watch programs, to leverage the work of plows so everyone can be mobile regardless of weather conditions.

<strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
My vision is to build a city where every Denverite, regardless of their neighborhood, can achieve their version of success. Today, this seems like a distant dream, but our first steps will be tackling our near term challenges in public safety, homelessness and affordability.

We also need a structural relationship between the city and Denver Public Schools. They are coterminous and inextricably linked in giving people a chance at controlling their futures.
We must develop and maintain trust between our city and the community to make our dream a reality.

<strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
Collaborating regionally to meet air quality standards is step one, particularly through aggressively managing all forms of carbon emissions. This includes increasing our role in transit by developing a local system, potentially with RTD, that connects the last mile efficiently to the regional system.

To avoid ground contamination we will exceed the highest standards for solid waste management.

Increasing connectivity to nature relies on real solutions to these challenges. The rewards will go beyond climate sustainability into a vibrant place and economy where protected nature is valued as a resource.

</aside><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
Crime is out of control in our city. As mayor, I will fight for Denver's future by adding 400 police officers to Denver's police force, increasing funding for police training, and lowering 911 response times to make our city safer.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
Blue collar workers, first-time homebuyers, and young families can't afford to live in our city. To make housing more affordable, I will fix a broken permitting department, eliminate regulations that are blocking affordable housing, and get corruption and money out of the zoning process.

<strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
I support converting the abandoned Park Hill golf course into both housing and a new park as proposed in the Westside plan. It is critical that Denver's teachers, police officers, and firefighters be able to afford to live in our city, and to make Denver affordable for first time home buyers and young families we need to build more housing.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
I will fight for the future of downtown Denver by aggressively enforcing the camping ban to get the homeless into the mental health and drug addiction services they need and by adding 400 police officers to the Denver police department. A safe downtown is a revitalized downtown.

<strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
The failure of the mayor and the City Council have led to a near tripling of murders over the past 10 years. We are one of the car theft capitals of the country. Denver deserves a mayor who will crack down on crime by adding 400 police officers, by increasing funding for police training, and by lowering 911 response times.

<strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
If we do not solve the underlying issues causing our affordable housing crisis, specifically a broken permitting department, regulations that are making it uneconomical to build affordable housing, zoning changes will not create enough housing for first-time home buyers, blue collar workers, and young families.

<strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
I will aggressively enforce the camping ban to get the homeless into the mental health and drug addiction services they need. Mayor Hancock has failed to enforce our camping ban, which has led to a doubling of unsheltered homeless over the past four years.

<strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
Our streets are not getting cleaned after snow storm. Denver deserves a mayor who will take charge and fight for Denver future by reducing crime, homelessness, and by plowing all our streets.

<strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
I love Denver, it is a vibrant, entrepreneurial city that still has its pioneer spirit. As my two daughters grow up, I want them to be safe, and to eventually be able to afford to buy a home and raise a family in Denver. I will use my experience as an Army veteran and small business owner to fight for Denver's future by reducing crime, homelessness, and the cost of housing in our city.

<strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
As mayor, I will invest in the infrastructure that powers our economy and protects our environment. Ignoring the maintenance needs of our roads and bridges has made traffic in Denver unbearable, costing Denver drivers an extra 36 hours a year in additional commute time and worsening our air.

</aside><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
Homelessness.

Compassion: the city will accelerate individualized services for those who need and want them, with a streamlined system to access services such as mental health, addiction, housing, and workforce support.

Coordination: the city will launch an outside audit of current programs and contracts, create a new city agency to integrate services, launch a public-facing dashboard to keep residents informed, and shift resources to serving people instead of just moving the problem around.

Accountability: the city will enforce laws, including the camping ban, and work with other levels of government to find solutions. Public safety teams will be empowered to enforce policies that ensure community safety, and illegal activities that cause harm or disruption will not be tolerated.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
Every Denverite deserves to have a home that meets their needs. Safe, stable, and affordable housing is the foundation for every individual’s and family’s success. Our housing isn’t just about buildings; it’s about who lives in them—and that means housing is about all of us. We need a dedicated program focused on workforce housing. If you are a teacher, a nurse, a bookseller, a police officer, a firefighter, you can no longer live here. As the son of a teacher, that’s absolutely unacceptable.

We need to look at places like Vienna, Austria, that has aggressively and successfully built workforce housing with principles that would work right here in Denver. In short, Vienna takes vacant land and incentivizes development that supports the adjacent community, similar to our neighborhoods.

<strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
<em>Candidate's answer was not responsive to the question.</em>

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
In order to revitalize downtown we need to focus on homelessness first, because businesses cannot sustain tents in front of their businesses.

We also need to look at adaptive reuse in upper downtown. Many of our downtown skyscrapers were vacant before the pandemic. We have a huge opportunity to transform these massive buildings into housing units. The growth in housing will also serve to help revitalize downtown. I will promote zoning policies to make these types of developments feasible and bountiful.

<strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
Rising crime is a top concern and priority. First, we need to restore the image of our police department. At its core, when you call the police from any neighborhood, they need to promptly respond. We need a mayor who supports our police officers but also one who holds them accountable.

Second, our police officers need to participate and engage in the neighborhood planning process and have officers assigned to specific neighborhoods and communities.

Lastly, we’re going to hire more officers and invest in a local pipeline. We should strive to retain and hire the very best police officers to work in our great city but it starts with welcoming and thanking the good actors for keeping us safe and giving them a seat at the table to tackle our crime issues.

<strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
City Council should create a neighborhood by neighborhood process for this that represents a broad set of local leaders, interested citizens, and randomly selected members like a jury to represent a full spectrum of perspectives.

We must also commit to a short, focused process. Too many city processes go on and on and on. As mayor I will commit to strong, purposeful community deliberation that sends a clear signal to the city council and city government. We cannot afford long, drawn out engagement that does not move our city forward.

<strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
Yes, we need to enforce the current laws.

<strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
We need to evaluate all on-call contracts with private operators to ensure we have the best and most responsive snow plow operators. We also need to develop a snow program that ensures sidewalks and bike lanes get the same city support that our roads do. And most importantly, internally and externally, we will create metrics that the city must achieve to ensure we're doing a good job. If we fail to meet these metrics, we'll find new partnerships to get the work done.

<strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
As a Denver native, what I appreciate the most about our city is the vibrancy of our neighborhoods. In order to keep our city great, we need to give all of our neighborhoods a voice. We have to work to prevent and limit crime in our neighborhoods and no longer allow people to exploit our homeless policies by choosing to live on the street. As a business owner, my priority is to ensure the safety of my staff and my customers but to also be sympathetic to those in need. We’re at a tipping point where we need specialized policies to empower local businesses, improve safety and re-energize the spirit and activity of our downtown.

<strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
With a focus on creating new jobs, improving air quality, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, my green energy policy will play a critical role in building a better future for Denver and its residents. We need strong city support for efforts to prevent ground contamination. I am committed to preserving Denver’s water resources and promoting water conservation measures throughout the city. I will work to implement water-saving technologies in city properties and encourage residents to adopt water-efficient practices. I will prioritize investments in climate-friendly transportation projects such as public transportation, cycling infrastructure, and pedestrian-friendly walkways to reduce car dependence and improve air quality in Denver.

</aside><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
Climate change is our biggest challenge, but also our biggest opportunity. Investing in environmental justice isn't just about "the weather." It's about breathing clean air, drinking clean water, and having healthy food on the table. It's when we go to work at a safe union job with a thriving wage, and come home to a warm place we can afford to live in. It’s owning our own energy as communities so our utility bills are low or zero. We have the excuse to remake the world, and we can build a world that works for everyone.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
As a fourth-generation Denverite, I know our leaders need to stop prioritizing corporate developers and start prioritizing everyday people. We need to make sure people can stay in the homes they already have by pushing rent control, a vacancy tax and tenant protections. Then we build more transitional housing and lower-income housing that’s affordable for working families, the disabled and the elderly. I have decades of experience fighting to require developments to have high percentages of low-income family housing, for inclusionary zoning and for community land trusts. I will continue that fight.

<strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
I believe we can come together to find solutions that increase housing and food access without sacrificing green space. I support honoring the easement and creating a public park with an urban farm and reforestation, with free produce for working families. There are underdeveloped lots nearby that work better for building housing and businesses.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
My vision for downtown is similar to my vision for the rest of the city: a clean, green neighborhood accessible to all, including pedestrians and disabled commuters. It has reasonable rent for small businesses and mixed income apartments where all Denverites enjoy a comfortable home, not just the wealthy. There’s bike lanes, expanded electric bus networks and thriving downtown parks. A creative arts scene is visited by locals and tourists alike. Too often “revitalization” in this city pushes our working families out or leaves them behind. I would make sure current residents lead the way and get to enjoy the results.

<strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
We have a mental health crisis, and a lot of other issues, like addiction, come from that. It’s always been hard to get affordable care. But everyone is isolated, traumatized and exhausted after years of pandemic. People are struggling to pay rent and put food on the table after working long hours in unsafe conditions. The city needs to create policies to reduce that stress of survival and invest in care. As a mentor to indigenous youth, I know what a huge difference investing in support and conflict resolution for our young people can make. Adults need hope too. We need to expand mental health resources, job training, community anti-violence programming, addiction services, harm reduction, and restorative justice that brings people together to heal.

<strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
Restricting neighborhoods to single-family houses contributes to a housing shortage and has a history of racist and classist exclusion. We need inclusionary zoning so families can expand their homes for renters or relatives and so we can build multi-family housing that fits more people. We especially need transitional and low-income housing. But we have to develop responsibly, so locals are never pushed out and necessities like groceries, healthcare, public transit and infrastructure develop at the same time. I also helped advance Denver’s Chicano Cultural Heritage District, the first in the country, so I believe in a balance with historic preservation.

<strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
I’ve always opposed the sweeps. After years of wasting taxpayer money cruelly forcing people from one block to another and back again, the unhoused population has tripled. The policy is a pointless, inhumane failure. I founded an organization to provide water and trash pickup to encampments because the sweeps don’t address these public health issues at all. Lots of research shows the fastest, cheapest way to get people off the streets is to get them into housing with wraparound services. In 2020, I presented a regional plan to rapidly get folks off the streets, and as mayor I would implement it while expanding programs that have actually been proven to work in Denver. We also have to address our housing crisis so nobody becomes homeless in the first place.

<strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
I respect and am grateful to the dedicated city workers who plow Denver’s streets. They’re doing an incredibly hard job. I think that the city needs to back them up, expanding the plowing the city is responsible for as well as pay and the staff. By focusing plowing on the biggest roads, Denverites who walk or roll–especially those who are disabled and/or take public transportation–are left in the lurch. The city has to take on plowing neighborhood streets and shoveling/melting pedestrian ways. We can come together to figure out how we do this in the safest way, without too much particle kick-up or runoff.

<strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
As an indigenous person, my philosophy is to make policies not only with the urgency people deserve today, but for the next seven generations. I see us in a positive relationship with one another, the water and the land. We’ll own renewable energy as neighborhoods, share food from community gardens, with housing for all. We’ll walk, roll, or bus to concerts. We’ll work hard–but not for exploitative bosses, just for each other. Everyone will have what they need. Maybe that sounds naive, but if our leaders don’t believe this is possible, they’re going to fall short delivering even the bare minimum. I have the political experience and willpower to start us on this path. Let’s build that world, a little each day.

<strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
This is my life’s work! The city has to expand electric public transport frequency, routes, and accessibility. We need to use state and federal dollars to replace lead pipes, and lower utility bills by retrofitting old buildings and creating community solar programs. We need requirements and incentives for developing sustainable, walkable neighborhoods. That’s a huge opportunity for workforce development and good jobs, and we also have to support workers in transitioning industries. The communities most impacted by pollution need to be at the table when we make these policies.

</aside><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
The homeless situation and how it is spinning out of control. I’m from the school of the “housing first “ approach. We need to start building now. I have a concrete plan to build housing for the homeless at 5-10 percent of what the city is spending now. My plan calls for cubicle, monolithic slab, SIP construction with pre engineered trusses designed to take full advantage of solar. Cost $25,000 per 16x16 unit. I’ll build 7,000 my first 18 months. It will be out by airport on annexed land by Adams County. We will work with Adams. Buying elevator loft building downtown and buying hotels to remodel is not the solution. It’s way too expensive. Tiny homes are a horrible idea too. Ask any builder.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
The city causes housing to be unnecessarily unaffordable. Builders' cost on waiting on permits gets passed on to the consumer. Expensive and unnecessary building regulations that get passed on to consumer. Illegal Airbnbs for years drove rents up. City did nothing for 6 years. Denver only zoned the city in certain areas for ADUs. City should have been zoned entirely for ADU. Would have kept costs down by increased density. I will revamp the building department right away. Permits that take a year will now take one day.

<strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
<em>Candidate's answer was not responsive to the question.</em>

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
Get the homeless out of there in 60 days upon taking office. After 60 days I will enforce the camping ban. The problem with enforcing it now i that we have nowhere to put them. I will immediately establish a legal camping area. Probably out by the airport. It will have fences with fabric to block the wind and act as shade in summer. It will have city funded portolets. It will have electricity so every person can have an electric blanket in winter. It will be the only legal area in the city to camp. It will be temporary until cubicle construction is on its way. Then homeless will transition into the cubicles. The homeless need to be removed from downtown. It’s a breeding ground for disease, drugs, panhandling, crime and rodents.

<strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
Getting a handle on the homeless situation. Getting the police more involved in the community they serve. Getting police to live in the districts they serve and allowing them to stay in that district. The police need to have that ownership stake in the districts they work in. We need to reduce gang violence in our city. Nothing hit me harder than speaking on the steps of the capitol during George Floyd and seeing my city in a state of chaos and violence. I cried in front of hundreds possibly thousands. We are better than this. We are. George Floyd can happen again. It can easily happen again tomorrow.

<strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
The zoning department and building department has been a mess for a long time. ADUs should have always been legal in all of Denver. I am confident we would not have an affordable housing problem right now if this were the case. I not sure what permissive zoning is but it sounds like something that is a waste of time and we have no time to waste. We need results and we need it fast. Even if we get city wide ADUs passed, it will take a year for a permit

<strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
We need somewhere for them to camp legally until I build the cubicles. I will provide a legal camping area within city limits out by the airport . This will be done in 60 days . After 60 days I will sweep the streets. Enforcement will be its fullest. It’s hard to comprehend how big of a problem we have until you pool them all together. Right now they are dispersed. They keep moving them around. It’s simply inhumane and unsanitary right now. They need bathrooms, Electricity for heat , and a legal camping area until we can get them into cost effective permanent housing. I will do this at a fraction of cost

<strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
Yes. We need to reevaluate the situations. It’s not as simple as “we will just plow main roads.” I know some roads and alleys that are ice skating rinks. Why? Because they are constantly shaded. We all know how powerful the sun is when it comes to clearing roads. We need to do a comprehensive sun light study on all of our roads. We need Denverites to help us . Use 311 to report hazardous roads . Some roads that didn’t used to be a hazard have become a hazard due to high rise development. I’ll name the first location. 39th avenue in Berkeley. Between Tennyson and Utica . Someone is going to get killed there. I encourage all Denverites to report all areas. I would also like to talk about the snow and sidewalks. That’s a separate but related issue.

<strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
My vision is that no Derverite will sleep in the cold. We will be the most humane city . Crime will be at its lowest levels . We will become a pilot city for EV transportation and renewable energy. We will be the city with the most charging stations in public right of ways in the country with the help of directional boring technology. We will be the city that generates the most solar energy in the country. Mother Nature would help us there too. In 2016 I designed and built a house with 28 solar panels. It powers all four of my EVs . I can drive 63,000 miles per year on solar. This is fact. Now that I’ve applied it to my own life … I need to apply this to the city. We are way behind . It’s not too late but it’s getting close.

<strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
My first week in office I will make perhaps the biggest and most impactful change to environmental policy in Denver regarding air quality. It will cost 0 dollars. It will be a building code amendment within the Denver amendments. It will forbid plumbing penetrations and turtle type roof venting on all southern facing roof plains. The number one killer of an immediate or future solar field are these obstructions. Only ridge in conjunction with eave venting will be permitted. It’s obvious that our electrical infrastructure is not ready. We need mini electrical producing power plants on many many rooftops. This is the sunniest place . Let’s go already !!!! We need to incentivize solar with local subsidies. I will incentivize directional boring projects to get chargers in all right places.

</aside><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
The most urgent issue facing our city is the massive disparity of wealth that separates wage earners from property owners. This disparity accounts for all social issues such as gentrification, low-income housing, unhoused population, etc. Solving this means using the mayor's office to direct resources to those at the bottom of the economic ladder.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
Solving affordable housing means helping those directly who survive on low wage work. I would push for a minimum wage that is a living wage, for an expanded Universal Basic Income program, for publicly supported worker centers that serve immigrant workers, and policies that make it easier for public employees to unionize and engage in collective bargaining.

I would also advocate for the use of city-owned property to be used for social housing development, doing whatever is necessary to get unhoused people into decent, permanent housing and to ensure that they can stay there.

<strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
No. I support preserving this as open space or a new park. Recent unchecked development and growing density has created a need for more open space within the city. This is a great opportunity to increase green areas in the city, particularly in NE Denver, where there is a great need for this.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
Again, addressing the plight of wage-earners and the unhoused in our city is the most direct path toward "revitalizing" downtown or any other area of the city. "Revitalize Downtown" has often been used as code for sweeping away the unhoused population from tourist areas. I would instead focus efforts on a streamlined effort to get them housed as quickly as possible. The city of Houston has had success, and we can look to many nations across the world who have largely solved the issue of homelessness.

The place to begin is with confronting the idea that people are unhoused through their own shortcomings, that they are to blame for their situation.

<strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
Denver's greatest public safety concern is the prevalence and use of guns, particularly weapons of war on our streets. I would enact policies to make Denver the safest city in the nation when it comes to gun violence. This means a massive gun buyback program, banning of assault weapons, universal background checks, and beefed up red flag laws. As mayor, I would feel a moral obligation to address the epidemic of mass shootings and gun violence.

<strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
Yes, I believe that every neighborhood carries some responsibility to absorb the continued growth, but would also support protections for Denver's many historic homes and neighborhoods. I believe that it's possible to do both. For example, changing zoning so that ADUs are legal in all neighborhoods. This increases diversity while maintaining a single-family home culture.

<strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
I would end sweeps and end the urban camping ban. All of my energies as mayor would go toward moving people into permanent, dignified housing. All public health and safety issues should be channeled through the practices and philosophy of harm reduction.

<strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
No. Using solar power to clear streets works in 95% of winters. This year's situation is rare. I would be in favor of changing the policy on an as-needed basis, ordering the plowing of backstreets in particularly harsh winters.

<strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
My vision for Denver in 20 years is the most worker-friendly city in the country, a space where those who clean, build, serve, and care for others can afford to live in--and purchase a home in--the city. Denver in 20 years will be a space where all workers enjoy support for forming unions and engaging in collective bargaining, and where no one is forced to work two or three jobs to survive. Harm reduction practices would guide all issues related to public health, including substance use, police tactics, incarceration, and the unhoused.

<strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
Denver should be replacing all old lead pipes and enforcing more stringent air quality penalties to improve air quality. Fracking should not be allowed within 50 miles of downtown Denver or within a mile of any residential area. Public transit should be free to all, ensuring that everyone can get around the city without problem. Finally, a massive expansion of green spaces, green roofs, and incentivizing the move to EVs will contribute to this.

</aside><strong>Briefly describe the single most urgent issue facing the city of Denver and how it should be addressed.</strong>
Encampments are our root problem and require our tough love. Encampments are destroying Denver physically, mentally and financially. If you have seen, smelled, or heard an encampment, I am sure you can quickly join me in acknowledging this as a humanitarian crisis. Shelter is the answer, provided by your city on its land and within its surplus buildings. To not shelter Denver’s neediest is inhumane and inexcusable.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to address the city's lack of affordable housing?</strong>
The big picture is demand exceeding supply. A couple smaller fixable issues are the state needs to address the length of time builders are liable for construction defects and our city needs to expedite P&amp;Z, building and fire reviews to lower costs. I also think there is an opportunity with the city balance sheet to assist credit worthy renters into home ownership and equity creation, which is a double win because it frees up a rental unit. I have a plan to broaden access to affordable health insurance, which should improve citizens' budgets for housing.

<strong>Do you support redevelopment at the Park Hill golf course property? Why or why not?</strong>
I am pro parks, pro green space, pro transit-oriented development, and pro affordable housing woven into the fabric of all appropriate neighborhoods, and this project seems to offer all of the above, but clearly the devil is always in the details of execution and enforcement, and citizens are rightfully concerned with their city's ability to uphold this responsibility. If the development delivers and maintains a 100- acre public park in perpetuity, at no cost to the city, that seems like an attractive deal versus the city bearing the expense of repurchasing the land, building the park, and maintaining it. I look forward to being mayor and implementing the voters' decision.

<strong>What should Denver leaders do to revitalize downtown Denver?</strong>
As stated above, the root cause is encampments which make our streets dangerous and filthy. These needy citizens must be removed and sheltered.

It is a vivid tale of two cities, upper downtown and lower downtown. Our upper downtown has a high concentration of office space, compounded by the fact that the majority of the tenants are car commuters, whereas lower downtown has a mix of office, residential, retail and entertainment, along with a transit hub.

We need to support redevelopment of upper downtown to have a winning mix of real estate types and uses. Surface parking lots that are poorly maintained and not landscaped, strike me as upper downtown's smile that is missing a few teeth.

<strong>What is Denver's greatest public safety concern and what should be done about it?</strong>
Encampments, encampments, encampments. They must be acknowledged as a humanitarian crisis and sheltered. Anything less is inhumane and inexcusable.

<strong>Should neighborhoods help absorb population growth through permissive zoning, or do you favor protections for single-family neighborhoods?</strong>
Our Planning and Zoning master plan or overlay was revised to better accommodate growth, and we also have the Comprehensive Plan 2040 and Blueprint Denver, which I believe provide adequate capacity within existing zoning. The R2 neighborhoods you mention, at their discretion, should be able to absorb additional population via accessory dwelling units, while preserving existing building envelopes.

<strong>Should the city's policy of sweeping homeless encampments continue unchanged? Why or why not?</strong>
Should our laws be enforced and should we deliver shelter to our neediest? YES!

Are we confronting this crisis in the proper way? NO!

This crisis requires the proper allocation of resources to divide and conquer. Since this population has been measured as chemically dependent, mentally ill and criminal, the appropriate corresponding resources are clinicians, social workers, and police officers respectively. This triage is the remedy to this crisis. We must acknowledge this as a humanitarian crisis and get this population sheltered.

<strong>Should Denver change its snow plowing policy? Why or why not.</strong>
When I researched this issue, as opposed to pandering to voters and screaming yes, I found a logical circumspect answer from Jim Charlier. See his take on the issue here: <a href="https://twitter.com/TheCharlier/status/1611478171484028928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">https://twitter.com/TheCharlier/status/1611478171484028928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</a>
It is clearly a tough balance between environmental impact and necessity.
So yes, specific to the "capillaries" of our transportation network and I think leveraging private machinery can alleviate the problem of larger storm cycles or prolonged cold spells.

<strong>What's your vision for Denver in 20 years, and what would you do to help the city get there?</strong>
A vibrant internationally recognized mecca, that functions effectively and equally for all of its diverse inhabitants. A safe clean smart oasis that benefited from fresh strong competent leadership's fiscal optimization which in turn generated social awareness and a greener city.

<strong>How better can city officials protect Denver's environment -- air quality, water supply, ground contamination? And should the city take a more active role in transit?</strong>
I office in LoDo near one of the largest EPA offices outside of Washington, D.C. and I am baffled as to why these issues, which frequently violate federal standards, are not policed and enforced to make offenders accountable for their actions. Violations are occurring literally under this division of the EPA's nose. To find the poster child and habitual violator for this issue, look just north to the Suncor refinery.

Yes our city should take a more active role in transit, including ensuring that our sidewalks are available equally and throughout as well as safe transit corridors for all the different two-wheel modes of transport like bicycles. Both of these efforts will make our citizens and planet healthier.
